<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_GAME">THE GAME</h2>
</div>


<p>Most people consider life a battle, but it is not a
battle, it is a game.</p>

<p>It is a game, however, which cannot be played
successfully without the knowledge of spiritual
law, and the Old and the New Testaments give the
rules of the game with wonderful clearness. Jesus
Christ taught that it was a great game of <em>Giving
and Receiving</em>.</p>

<p>“Whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also
reap.” This means that whatever man sends out in
word or deed, will return to him; what he gives, he
will receive.</p>

<p>If he gives hate, he will receive hate; if he gives
love, he will receive love; if he gives criticism, he
will receive criticism; if he lies he will be lied to; if
he cheats he will be cheated. We are taught also,
that the imaging faculty plays a leading part in
the game of life.</p>

<p>“Keep thy heart (or imagination) with all diligence,
for out of it are the issues of life.” (Prov.
4:23.)</p>

<p>This means that what man images, sooner or
later externalizes in his affairs. I know of a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
who feared a certain disease. It was a very rare
disease and difficult to get, but he pictured it continually
and read about it until it manifested in his
body, and he died, the victim of distorted imagination.</p>

<p>So we see, to play successfully the game of life,
we must train the imaging faculty. A person with
an imaging faculty trained to image only good,
brings into his life “every righteous desire of his
heart”—health, wealth, love, friends, perfect self-expression,
his highest ideals.</p>

<p>The imagination has been called, “<em>The Scissors
of The Mind</em>,” and it is ever cutting, cutting, day
by day, the pictures man sees there, and sooner or
later he meets his own creations in his outer world.
To train the imagination successfully, man must
understand the workings of his mind. The Greeks
said: “Know Thyself.”</p>

<p>There are three departments of the mind, the
<em>subconscious, conscious and superconscious</em>. The
subconscious, is simply power, without direction.
It is like steam or electricity, and it does what it is
directed to do; it has no power of induction.</p>

<p>Whatever man feels deeply or images clearly, is
impressed upon the subconscious mind, and carried
out in minutest detail.</p>

<p>For example: a woman I know, when a child,
always “made believe” she was a widow. She
“dressed up” in black clothes and wore a long
black veil, and people thought she was very clever
and amusing. She grew up and married a man
with whom she was deeply in love. In a short time
he died and she wore black and a sweeping veil for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
many years. The picture of herself as a widow was
impressed upon the subconscious mind, and in
due time worked itself out, regardless of the havoc
created.</p>

<p>The conscious mind has been called mortal or
carnal mind.</p>

<p>It is the human mind and sees life as it <em>appears
to be</em>. It sees death, disaster, sickness, poverty and
limitation of every kind, and it impresses the subconscious.</p>

<p>The <em>superconscious</em> mind is the God Mind within
each man, and is the realm of perfect ideas.</p>

<p>In it, is the “<em>perfect pattern</em>” spoken of by Plato,
<em>The Divine Design</em>; for there is a <em>Divine Design</em> for
each person.</p>

<p>“<em>There is a place that you are to fill and no one
else can fill, something you are to do, which no
one else can do.</em>”</p>

<p>There is a perfect picture of this in the <em>superconscious
mind</em>. It usually flashes across the conscious
as an unattainable ideal—“something too
good to be true.”</p>

<p>In reality it is man’s true destiny (or destination)
flashed to him from the Infinite Intelligence which
is <em>within himself</em>.</p>

<p>Many people, however, are in ignorance of their
true destinies and are striving for things and situations
which do not belong to them, and would
only bring failure and dissatisfaction if attained.</p>

<p>For example: A woman came to me and asked
me to “speak the word” that she would marry a
certain man with whom she was very much in love.
(She called him A. B.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>I replied that this would be a violation of spiritual
law, but that I would speak the word for the
right man, the “divine selection,” the man who
belonged to her by divine right.</p>

<p>I added, “If A. B. is the right man you can’t lose
him, and if he isn’t, you will receive his equivalent.”
She saw A. B. frequently but no headway
was made in their friendship. One evening she
called, and said, “Do you know, for the last week,
A. B. hasn’t seemed so wonderful to me.” I replied,
“Maybe he is not the divine selection—another
man may be the right one.” Soon after
that, she met another man who fell in love with
her at once, and who said she was his ideal. In
fact, he said all the things that she had always
wished A. B. would say to her.</p>

<p>She remarked, “It was quite uncanny.”</p>

<p>She soon returned his love, and lost all interest
in A. B.</p>

<p>This shows the law of substitution. A right idea
was substituted for a wrong one, therefore there
was no loss or sacrifice involved.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ said, “Seek ye first the Kingdom of
God and his righteousness; and all these things
shall be added unto you,” and he said the Kingdom
<em>was within man</em>.</p>

<p>The Kingdom is the realm of <em>right ideas</em>, or the
divine pattern.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ taught that man’s words played a
leading part in the game of life. “By your words ye
are justified and by your words ye are condemned.”</p>

<p>Many people have brought disaster into their
lives through idle words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>For example: A woman once asked me why her
life was now one of poverty of limitation. Formerly
she had a home, was surrounded by beautiful
things and had plenty of money. We found she
had often tired of the management of her home,
and had said repeatedly, “I’m sick and tired of
things—I wish I lived in a trunk,” and she added:
“Today I am living in that trunk.” She had spoken
herself into a trunk. The subconscious mind has
no sense of humor and people often joke themselves
into unhappy experiences.</p>

<p>For example: A woman who had a great deal of
money, joked continually about “getting ready for
the poorhouse.”</p>

<p>In a few years she was almost destitute, having
impressed the subconscious mind with a picture of
lack and limitation.</p>

<p>Fortunately the law works both ways, and a
situation of lack may be changed to one of plenty.</p>

<p>For example: A woman came to me one hot
summer’s day for a “treatment” for prosperity.
She was worn out, dejected and discouraged. She
said she possessed just eight dollars in the world. I
said, “Good, we’ll bless the eight dollars and multiply
them as Jesus Christ multiplied the loaves
and the fishes,” for He taught that <em>every man</em> had
the power to bless and to multiply, to heal and to
prosper.</p>

<p>She said, “What shall I do next?”</p>

<p>I replied, “Follow intuition. Have you a ‘hunch’
to do anything, or to go anywhere?” Intuition
means, intuition, or to be taught from within. It is
man’s unerring guide, and I will deal more fully
with its laws in a following chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>The woman replied: “I don’t know—I seem to
have a ‘hunch’ to go home; I’ve just enough money
for carfare.” Her home was in a distant city and
was one of lack and limitation, and the reasoning
mind (or intellect) would have said: “Stay in New
York and get work and make some money.” I
replied, “Then go home—never violate a hunch.”
I spoke the following words for her: “<em>Infinite Spirit
open the way for great abundance for ——. She is
an irresistible magnet for all that belongs to her by
divine right.</em>” I told her to repeat it continually
also. She left for home immediately. In calling on
a woman one day, she linked up with an old friend
of her family.</p>

<p>Through this friend, she received thousands of
dollars in a most miraculous way. She has said to
me often, “Tell people about the woman who
came to you with eight dollars and a hunch.”</p>

<p>There is always <em>plenty on man’s pathway</em>; but it
can only be <em>brought into manifestation</em> through
desire, faith or the spoken word. Jesus Christ
brought out clearly that man must make the <em>first
move</em>.</p>

<p>“<em>Ask</em>, and it shall be given you, seek, and ye
shall find, knock, and it shall be opened unto you.”
(Mat. 7:7.)</p>

<p>In the Scriptures we read:</p>

<p>“Concerning the works of my hands, command
ye me.”</p>

<p>Infinite Intelligence, God, is ever ready to carry
out man’s smallest or greatest demands.</p>

<p>Every desire, uttered or unexpressed, is a demand.
We are often startled by having a wish
suddenly fulfilled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>For example: One Easter, having seen many
beautiful rose-trees in the florists’ windows, I
wished I would receive one, and for an instant saw
it mentally being carried in the door.</p>

<p>Easter came, and with it a beautiful rose-tree. I
thanked my friend the following day, and told her
it was just what I had wanted.</p>

<p>She replied, “I didn’t send you a rose-tree, I sent
you lilies!”</p>

<p>The man had mixed the order, and sent me a
rose-tree simply because I had started the law in
action, and <em>I had to have a rose-tree</em>.</p>

<p>Nothing stands between man and his highest
ideals and every desire of his heart, but doubt and
fear. When man can “wish without worrying,”
every desire will be instantly fulfilled.</p>

<p>I will explain more fully in a following chapter
the scientific reason for this and how fear must be
erased from the consciousness. It is man’s only
enemy—fear of lack, fear of failure, fear of sickness,
fear of loss and a feeling of <em>insecurity on
some plane</em>. Jesus Christ said: “Why are ye fearful,
oh ye of little faith?” (Mat. 8:26.) So we can see we
must substitute faith for fear, for fear is only
inverted faith; it is faith in evil instead of good.</p>

<p>The object of the game of life is to see clearly
one’s good and to obliterate all mental pictures of
evil. This must be done by impressing the subconscious
mind with a realization of good. A very
brilliant man, who has attained great success, told
me he had suddenly erased all fear from his consciousness
by reading a sign which hung in a room.
He saw printed, in large letters this statement—“<em>Why
worry, it will probably never happen.</em>” These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
words were stamped indelibly upon his subconscious
mind, and he has now a firm conviction that
only good can come into his life, therefore only
<em>good can manifest</em>.</p>

<p>In the following chapter I will deal with the
different methods of impressing the subconscious
mind. It is man’s faithful servant but one must be
careful to give it the right orders. Man has ever a
silent listener at his side—his subconscious mind.</p>

<p>Every thought, every word is impressed upon it
and carried out in amazing detail. It is like a singer
making a record on the sensitive disc of the phonographic
plate. Every note and tone of the singer’s
voice is registered. If he coughs or hesitates, it is
registered also. So let us break all the old bad
records in the subconscious mind, the records of
our lives which we do not wish to keep, and make
new and beautiful ones.</p>

<p>Speak these words aloud, with power and conviction:
“I now smash and demolish (by my spoken
word) every untrue record in my subconscious
mind. They shall return to the dust-heap of their
native nothingness, for they came from my own
vain imaginings. I now make my perfect records
through the Christ within—The records of <em>Health,
Wealth, Love and perfect self-Expression</em>.” This is
the square of life, <em>The Game completed</em>.</p>

<p>In the following chapters, I will show how man
can <em>change</em> his <em>conditions by changing his words</em>.
Any man who does not know the power of the
word, is behind the times.</p>

<p>One of the greatest messages given to the race
through the scriptures is that God is man’s supply
and that man can release, <em>through his spoken
word</em>, all that belongs to him by divine right. He
must, however, have <em>perfect faith in his spoken
word</em>.</p>

<p>Isaiah said, “My word shall not return unto me
void, but shall accomplish that where unto it is
sent.” We know now, that words and thoughts are a
tremendous vibratory force, ever moulding man’s
body and affairs.</p>

<p>A woman came to me in great distress and said
she was to be sued on the fifteenth of the month for
three thousand dollars. She knew no way of getting
the money and was in despair.</p>

<p>I told her God was her supply, and <em>that there is a
supply for every demand</em>.</p>

<p><em>So I spoke the word!</em> I gave thanks that the
woman would receive three thousand dollars at the
right time in the right way. I told her she must have
perfect faith, and act her <em>perfect faith</em>. The fifteenth
came but no money had materialized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>She called me on the ’phone and asked what she
was to do.</p>

<p>I replied, “It is Saturday, so they won’t sue you
today. Your part is to act rich, thereby showing
perfect faith that you will receive it by Monday.”
She asked me to lunch with her to keep up her
courage. When I joined her at a restaurant, I said,
“This is no time to economize. Order an expensive
luncheon, act as if you have already received the
three thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“All things whatsoever ye ask in prayer, <em>believing</em>,
ye shall receive.” “You must act as if you <em>had
already received</em>.” The next morning she called me
on the ’phone and asked me to stay with her during
the day. I said “No, you are divinely protected
and God is never too late.”</p>

<p>In the evening she ’phoned again, greatly excited
and said, “My dear, a miracle has happened! I was
sitting in my room this morning, when the doorbell
rang. I said to the maid: ‘Don’t let anyone in.’
The maid however, looked out the window and
said, ‘It’s your cousin with the long white beard.’</p>

<p>So I said, ‘Call him back. I would like to see him.’
He was just turning the corner, when he heard the
maid’s voice, and <em>he came back</em>.</p>

<p>He talked for about an hour, and just as he was
leaving he said, ‘Oh, by the way, how are finances?’</p>

<p>I told him I needed the money, and he said,
‘Why, my dear, I will give you three thousand
dollars the first of the month.’</p>

<p>I didn’t like to tell him I was going to be sued.
What shall I do? I won’t <em>receive it till</em> the first of the
month, and I must have it tomorrow.” I said, “I’ll
keep on ‘treating.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>I said, “Spirit is never too late. I give thanks she
has received the money on the invisible plane and
that it manifests on time.” The next morning her
cousin called her up and said, “Come to my office
this morning and I will give you the money.” That
afternoon, she had three thousand dollars to her
credit in the bank, and wrote checks as rapidly as
her excitement would permit.</p>

<p>If one asks for success and prepares for failure,
he will get the situation he has prepared for. For
example: A man came to me asking me to speak the
word that a certain debt would be wiped out.</p>

<p>I found he spent his time planning what he
would say to the man when he did not pay his bill,
thereby neutralizing my words. He should have
seen himself paying the debt.</p>

<p>We have a wonderful illustration of this in the
bible, relating to the three kings who were in the
desert, without water for their men and horses.
They consulted the prophet Elisha, who gave them
this astonishing message:</p>

<p>“Thus saith the Lord—Ye shall not see wind,
neither shall ye see rain, yet make this valley full of
ditches.”</p>

<p>Man must prepare for the thing he has asked for,
<em>when there isn’t the slightest sign of it in sight</em>.</p>

<p>For example: A woman found it necessary to
look for an apartment during the year when there
was a great shortage of apartments in New York. It
was considered almost an impossibility, and her
friends were sorry for her and said, “Isn’t it too bad,
you’ll have to store your furniture and live in a
hotel.” She replied, “<em>You needn’t feel sorry for me,
I’m a superman, and I’ll get an apartment.</em>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>She spoke the words: “<em>Infinite Spirit, open the
way for the right apartment.</em>” She knew there was a
supply for every demand, and that she was “unconditioned,”
working on the spiritual plane, and that
“one with God is a majority.”</p>

<p>She had contemplated buying new blankets,
when “the tempter,” the adverse thought or reasoning
mind, suggested, “Don’t buy the blankets, perhaps,
after all, you won’t get an apartment and you
will have no use for them.” She promptly replied (to
herself): “I’ll dig my ditches by buying the blankets!”
So she prepared for the apartment—acted as
though she already had it.</p>

<p>She found one in a miraculous way, and it was
given to her although there were over <em>two hundred
other applicants</em>.</p>

<p>The blankets showed active faith.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that the ditches dug by the
three kings in the desert were filled to over-flowing.
(Read, II Kings.)</p>

<p>Getting into the spiritual swing of things is no
easy matter for the average person. The adverse
thoughts of doubt and fear surge from the subconscious.
They are the “army of the aliens” which
must be put to flight. This explains why it is so
often, “darkest before the dawn.”</p>

<p>A big demonstration is usually preceded by tormenting
thoughts.</p>

<p>Having made a statement of high spiritual truth
one challenges the old beliefs in the subconscious,
and “error is exposed” to be put out.</p>

<p>This is the time when one must make his affirmations
of truth repeatedly, and rejoice and give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
thanks that he has already received. “Before ye call
I shall answer.” This means that “every good and
perfect gift” is already man’s awaiting his recognition.</p>

<p>Man can only receive what he sees himself receiving.</p>

<p>The children of Israel were told that they could
have all the land they could see. This is true of every
man. He has only the land within his own mental
vision. Every great work, every big accomplishment,
has been brought into manifestation
through holding to the vision, and often just before
the big achievement, comes apparent failure and
discouragement.</p>

<p>The children of Israel when they reached the
“Promised Land,” were afraid to go in, for they
said it was filled with giants who made them feel
like grasshoppers. “And there we saw the giants
and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers.”
This is almost every man’s experience.</p>

<p>However, the one who knows spiritual law, is
undisturbed by appearance, and rejoices while he
is “yet in captivity.” That is, he holds to his vision
and gives thanks that the end is accomplished, he
has received.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ gave a wonderful example of this. He
said to his disciples: “Say not ye, there are yet four
months and then cometh the harvest? Behold, I say
unto you, lift up your eyes and look on the fields;
for they are ripe already to harvest.” His clear
vision pierced the “world of matter” and he saw
clearly the fourth dimensional world, things as they
really are, perfect and complete in Divine Mind. So<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
man must ever hold the vision of his journey’s end
and demand the manifestation of that which he has
already received. It may be his perfect health, love,
supply, self-expression, home or friends.</p>

<p>They are all finished and perfect ideas registered
in Divine Mind (man’s own superconscious mind)
and must come through him, not to him. For
example: A man came to me asking for treatments
for success. It was imperative that he raise, within a
certain time, fifty-thousand dollars for his business.
The time limit was almost up, when he came to me
in despair. No one wanted to invest in his enterprise,
and the bank had flatly refused a loan. I
replied: “I suppose you lost your temper while at
the bank, therefore your power. You can control
any situation if you first control yourself.” “Go back
to the bank,” I added, “and I will treat.” My treatment
was: “You are identified in love with the spirit
of everyone connected with the bank. Let the
divine idea come out of this situation.” He replied,
“Woman, you are talking about an impossibility.
Tomorrow is Saturday; the bank closes at twelve,
and my train won’t get me there until ten, and the
time limit is up tomorrow, and anyway they won’t
do it. It’s too late.” I replied, “God doesn’t need any
time and is never too late. With Him all things are
possible.” I added, “I don’t know anything about
business, but I know all about God.” He replied: “It
all sounds fine when I sit here listening to you, but
when I go out it’s terrible.” He lived in a distant
city, and I did not hear from him for a week, then
came a letter. It read: “You were right. I raised the
money, and will never again doubt the truth of all
that you told me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>I saw him a few weeks later, and I said, “What
happened? You evidently had plenty of time, after
all.” He replied “My train was late, and I got there
just fifteen minutes to twelve. I walked into the
bank quietly and said, ‘I have come for the loan,’
and they gave it to me without a question.”</p>

<p>It was the last fifteen minutes of the time allotted
to him, and Infinite Spirit was not too late. In this
instance the man could never have demonstrated
alone. He needed someone to help him hold to the
vision. This is what one man can do for another.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ knew the truth of this when he said:
“If two of you shall agree on earth as touching
anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for
them of my Father which is in heaven.” One gets
too close to his own affairs and becomes doubtful
and fearful.</p>

<p>The friend or “healer” sees clearly the success,
health, or prosperity, and never wavers, because he
is not close to the situation.</p>

<p>It is much easier to “demonstrate” for someone
else than for one’s self, so a person should not
hesitate to ask for help, if he feels himself wavering.</p>

<p>A keen observer of life once said, “no man can
fail, if some one person sees him successful.” Such is
the power of the vision, and many a great man has
owed his success to a wife, or sister, or a friend who
“believed in him” and held without wavering to the
perfect pattern!</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>A person knowing the power of the word, becomes
very careful of his conversation. He has only
to watch the reaction of his words to know that they
do “not return void.” Through his spoken word,
man is continually making laws for himself.</p>

<p>I knew a man who said, “I always miss a car. It
invariably pulls out just as I arrive.”</p>

<p>His daughter said: “I always catch a car. It’s sure
to come just as I get there.” This occurred for years.
Each had made a separate law for himself, one of
failure, one of success. This is the psychology of
superstitions.</p>

<p>The horseshoe or rabbit’s foot contains no
power, but man’s spoken word and belief that it
will bring him good luck creates expectancy in the
subconscious mind, and attracts a “lucky situation.”
I find however, this will not “work” when
man has advanced spiritually and knows a higher
law. One cannot turn back, and must put away
“graven images.” For example: Two men in my
class had had great success in business for several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
months, when suddenly everything “went to
smash.” We tried to analyze the situation, and I
found, instead of making their affirmations and
looking to God for success and prosperity, they had
each bought a “lucky monkey.” I said: “Oh I see,
you have been trusting in the lucky monkeys instead
of God.” “Put away the lucky monkeys and call on
the law of forgiveness,” for man has power to
forgive or neutralize his mistakes.</p>

<p>They decided to throw the lucky monkeys down a
coalhole, and all went well again. This does not
mean, however, that one should throw away every
“lucky” ornament or horseshoe about the house,
but he must recognize that the power back of it is
the one and only power, God, and that the object
simply gives him a feeling of expectancy.</p>

<p>I was with a friend, one day, who was in deep
despair. In crossing the street, she picked up a
horseshoe. Immediately, she was filled with joy and
hope. She said God had sent her the horseshoe in
order to keep up her courage.</p>

<p>It was indeed, at that moment, about the only
thing that could have registered in her consciousness.
Her hope became faith, and she ultimately
made a wonderful demonstration. I wish to make
the point clear that the men previously mentioned
were depending on the monkeys, alone, while this
woman recognized the power back of the horseshoe.</p>

<p>I know, in my own case, it took a long while to get
out of a belief that a certain thing brought disappointment.
If the thing happened, disappointment
invariably followed. I found the only way I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
make a change in the subconscious, was by asserting,
“There are not two powers, there is only one
power, God, therefore, there are no disappointments,
and this thing means a happy surprise.” I
noticed a change at once, and happy surprises
commenced coming my way.</p>

<p>I have a friend who said nothing could induce
her to walk under a ladder. I said, “If you are
afraid, you are giving in to a belief in two powers,
Good and Evil, instead of one. As God is absolute,
there can be no opposing power, unless man makes
the false of evil for himself. To show you believe in
only One Power, God, and that there is no power or
reality in evil, walk under the next ladder you see.”
Soon after, she went to her bank. She wished to
open her box in the safe-deposit vault, and there
stood a ladder on her pathway. It was impossible to
reach the box without passing under the ladder.
She quailed with fear and turned back. She could
not face the lion on her pathway. However, when
she reached the street, my words rang in her ears
and she decided to return and walk under it. It was
a big moment in her life, for ladders had held her in
bondage for years. She retraced her steps to the
vault, and the ladder was no longer there! This so
often happens! If one is willing to do a thing he is
afraid to do, he does not have to.</p>

<p>It is the law of nonresistance, which is so little
understood.</p>

<p>Someone has said that courage contains genius
and magic. Face a situation fearlessly, and there is
no situation to face; it falls away of its own weight.</p>

<p>The explanation is, that fear attracted the ladder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
on the woman’s pathway, and fearlessness removed
it.</p>

<p><em>Thus the invisible forces are ever working for
man who is always “pulling the strings” himself,
though he does not know it. Owing to the vibratory
power of words, whatever man voices, he begins to
attract. People who continually speak of disease,
invariably attract it.</em></p>

<p>After man knows the truth, he cannot be too
careful of his words. For example: I have a friend
who often says on the ’phone, “Do come to see me
and have a fine old-fashioned chat.” This “old-fashioned
chat” means an hour of about five hundred
to a thousand destructive words, the principal
topics being loss, lack, failure and sickness.</p>

<p>I reply: “No, I thank you, I’ve had enough old-fashioned
chats in my life, they are too expensive,
but I will be glad to have a new-fashioned chat, and
talk about what we want, not what we don’t want.”
There is an old saying that man only dares use his
words for three purposes, to “heal, bless or prosper.”
What man says of others will be said of him,
and what he wishes for another, he is wishing for
himself.</p>

<p>“Curses, like chickens, come home to roost.”</p>

<p>If a man wishes someone “bad luck,” he is sure to
attract bad luck himself. If he wishes to aid someone
to success, he is wishing and aiding himself to
success.</p>

<p>The body may be renewed and transformed
through the spoken word and clear vision, and
disease be completely wiped out of the consciousness.
The metaphysician knows that all disease has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
a mental correspondence, and in order to heal the
body one must first “heal the soul.”</p>

<p>The soul is the subconscious mind, and it must
be “saved” from wrong thinking.</p>

<p>In the twenty-third psalm, we read: “He restoreth
my soul.” This means that the subconscious
mind or soul, must be restored with the right ideas,
and the “mystical marriage” is the marriage of the
soul and the spirit, or the subconscious and superconscious
mind. They must be one. When the subconscious
is flooded with the perfect ideas of the
superconscious, God and man are one. “I and the
Father are one.” That is, he is one with the realm of
perfect ideas; he is the man made in God’s likeness
and image (imagination) and is given power and
dominion over all created things, his mind, body
and affairs.</p>

<p>It is safe to say that all sickness and unhappiness
come from the violation of the law of love. A new
commandment I give unto you, “Love one another,”
and in the Game of Life, love or good-will
takes every trick.</p>

<p>For example: A woman I know, had, for years an
appearance of a terrible skin disease. The doctors
told her it was incurable, and she was in despair.
She was on the stage, and she feared she would soon
have to give up her profession, and she had no other
means of support. She, however, procured a good
engagement, and on the opening night, made a
great “hit.” She received flattering notices from the
critics, and was joyful and elated. The next day she
received a notice of dismissal. A man in the cast
had been jealous of her success and had caused her
to be sent away. She felt hatred and resentment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
taking complete possession of her, and she cried
out, “Oh God don’t let me hate that man.” That
night she worked for hours “in the silence.”</p>

<p>She said, “I soon came into a very deep silence. I
seemed to be at peace with myself, with the man,
and with the whole world. I continued this for two
following nights, and on the third day I found I was
healed completely of the skin disease!” In asking for
love, or good will, she had fulfilled the law, (“for
love is the fulfilling of the law”) and the disease
(which came from subconscious resentment) was
wiped out.</p>

<p>Continual criticism produces rheumatism, as
critical, inharmonious thoughts cause unnatural
deposits in the blood, which settle in the joints.</p>

<p>False growths are caused by jealousy, hatred,
unforgiveness, fear, etc. Every disease is caused by
a mind not at ease. I said once, in my class, “There
is no use asking anyone ‘What’s the matter with
you?’ we might just as well say, ‘Who’s the matter
with you?’” Unforgiveness is the most prolific cause
of disease. It will harden arteries or liver, and affect
the eye-sight. In its train are endless ills.</p>

<p>I called on a woman, one day, who said she was
ill from having eaten a poisoned oyster. I replied,
“Oh, no, the oyster was harmless, you poisoned the
oyster. What’s the matter with you?” She answered,
“Oh about nineteen people.” She had quarrelled
with nineteen people and had become so inharmonious
that she attracted the wrong oyster.</p>

<p>Any inharmony on the external, indicates there
is mental inharmony. “As the within, so the without.”</p>

<p>Man’s only enemies are within himself. “And a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
man’s foes shall be they of his own household.”
Personality is one of the last enemies to be overcome,
as this planet is taking its initiation in love. It
was Christ’s message—“Peace on Earth, good will
towards man.” The enlightened man, therefore,
endeavors to perfect himself upon his neighbor. His
work is with himself, to send out good-will and
blessings to every man, and the marvelous thing is,
that if one blesses a man he has no power to harm
him.</p>

<p>For example: A man came to me asking to
“treat” for success in business. He was selling
machinery, and a rival appeared on the scene with
what he proclaimed, was a better machine, and my
friend feared defeat. I said, “First of all, we must
wipe out all fear, and know that God protects your
interests, and that the divine idea must come out of
the situation. That is, the right machine will be
sold, by the right man, to the right man.” And I
added, “Don’t hold one critical thought towards
that man. Bless him all day, and be willing not to
sell your machine, if it isn’t the divine idea.” So he
went to the meeting, fearless and nonresistant, and
blessing the other man. He said the outcome was
very remarkable. The other man’s machine refused
to work, and he sold his without the slightest difficulty.
“But I say unto you, love your enemies, bless
them that curse you, do good to them that hate
you, and pray for them which spitefully use you and
persecute you.”</p>

<p><em>Good-will produces a great aura of protection
about the one who sends it, and “No weapon that is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
formed against him shall prosper.” In other words,
love and good-will destroy the enemies within one’s
self, therefore, one has no enemies on the external!</em></p>

<p>“<em>There is peace on earth for him who sends good-will
to man!</em>”</p>

</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Resist not evil. Be not overcome of evil,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">but overcome evil with good.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Nothing on earth can resist an absolutely nonresistant
person.</p>

<p>The Chinese say that water is the most powerful
element, because it is perfectly nonresistant. It can
wear away a rock, and sweep all before it.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ said, “Resist not evil,” for He knew in
reality, there is no evil, therefore nothing to resist.
Evil has come of man’s “vain imagination,” or a
belief in two powers, good and evil.</p>

<p>There is an old legend, that Adam and Eve ate of
“Maya the Tree of Illusion,” and saw two powers
instead of one power, God.</p>

<p><em>Therefore, evil is a false law man has made for
himself, through psychoma or soul sleep.</em> Soul sleep
means, that man’s soul has been hypnotized by the
race belief (of sin, sickness and death, etc.) which is
carnal or mortal thought, and his affairs have outpictured
his illusions.</p>

<p>We have read in a preceding chapter, that man’s
soul is his subconscious mind, and whatever he feels
deeply, good or bad, is outpictured by that faithful
servant. His body and affairs show forth what he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
has been picturing. The sick man has pictured sickness,
the poor man, poverty, the rich man, wealth.</p>

<p>People often say, “why does a little child attract
illness, when it is too young even to know what it
means?”</p>

<p>I answer that children are sensitive and receptive
to the thoughts of others about them, and often
outpicture the fears of their parents.</p>

<p>I heard a metaphysician once say, “If you do not
run your subconscious mind yourself, someone else
will run it for you.”</p>

<p>Mothers often, unconsciously, attract illness and
disaster to their children, by continually holding
them in thoughts of fear, and watching for symptoms.</p>

<p>For example: A friend asked a woman if her little
girl had had the measles. She replied promptly,
“not yet!” This implied that she was expecting the
illness, and, therefore, preparing the way for what
she did not want for herself and child.</p>

<p>However, the man who is centered and established
in right thinking, the man who sends out
only good-will to his fellow-man, and who is without
fear, cannot be <em>touched or influenced by the
negative thoughts of others</em>. In fact, he could then
receive only good thoughts, as he himself, sends
forth only good thoughts.</p>

<p>Resistance is Hell, for it places man in a “state of
torment.”</p>

<p>A metaphysician once gave me a wonderful recipe
for taking every trick in the game of life, it is the
acme of nonresistance. He gave it in this way; “At
one time in my life, I baptized children, and of
course, they had many names. Now I no longer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
baptize children, but I baptize events, but <em>I give
every event the same name</em>. If I have a failure I
baptize it success, in the name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost!”</p>

<p>In this, we see the great law of transmutation,
founded on nonresistance. Through his spoken
word, every failure was transmuted into success.</p>

<p>For example: A woman who required money,
and who knew the spiritual law of opulence, was
thrown continually in a business-way, with a man
who made her feel very poor. He talked lack and
limitation and she commenced to catch his poverty
thoughts, so she disliked him, and blamed him for
her failure. She knew in order to demonstrate her
supply, she must first feel that she <em>had received—a
feeling of opulence must precede its manifestation</em>.</p>

<p>It dawned upon her, one day, that she was resisting
the situation, and seeing two powers instead of
one. So she blessed the man and baptized the
situation “Success”! She affirmed, “As there is only
one power, God, this man is here for my good and
my prosperity” (just what he did not seem to be
there for). Soon after that she met, <em>through this
man</em>, a woman who gave her for a service rendered,
several thousand dollars, and the man moved to a
distant city, and faded harmoniously from her life.
Make the statement, “Every man is a golden link in
the chain of my good,” for all men are God in
manifestation, <em>awaiting the opportunity given by
man, himself, to serve the divine plan of his life</em>.</p>

<p>“Bless your enemy, and you rob him of his
ammunition.” His arrows will be transmuted into
blessings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>This law is true of nations as well as individuals.
Bless a nation, send love and good-will to every
inhabitant, and it is robbed of its power to harm.</p>

<p>Man can only get the right idea of nonresistance,
through spiritual understanding. My students have
often said: “I don’t want to be a door-mat.” I reply
“when you use nonresistance with wisdom, no one
will ever be able to walk over you.”</p>

<p>Another example: One day I was impatiently
awaiting an important telephone call. I resisted
every call that came in and made no out-going calls
myself, reasoning that it might interfere with the
one I was awaiting.</p>

<p>Instead of saying, “Divine ideas never conflict,
the call will come at the right time,” leaving it to
Infinite Intelligence to arrange, I commenced to
manage things myself—I made the battle mine,
not God’s and remained tense and anxious. The
bell did not ring for about an hour, and I glanced
at the ’phone and found the receiver had been off
that length of time, and the ’phone was disconnected.
My anxiety, fear and belief in interference,
had brought on a total eclipse of the telephone.
Realizing what I had done, I commenced blessing
the situation at once; I baptized it “success,” and
affirmed, “I cannot lose any call that belongs to me
by divine right; I am under <em>grace, and not under
law</em>.”</p>

<p>A friend rushed out to the nearest telephone, to
notify the Company to reconnect.</p>

<p>She entered a crowded grocery, but the proprietor
left his customers and attended to the call
himself. My ’phone was connected at once, and two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
minutes later, I received a very important call, and
about an hour afterward, the one I had been
awaiting.</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent">
<em>One’s ships come in over a calm sea.</em><br>
</p>
<br>

<p>So long as man resists a situation, he will have it
with him. If he runs away from it, it will run after
him.</p>

<p>For example: I repeated this to a woman one
day, and she replied, “How true that is! I was
unhappy at home, I disliked my mother, who was
critical and domineering; so I ran away and was
married—but I married my mother, for my husband
was exactly like my mother, and I had the
same situation to face again.” “Agree with thine
adversary quickly.”</p>

<p>That means, agree that the adverse situation is
good, be undisturbed by it, and it falls away of its
own weight. “None of these things move me,” is a
wonderful affirmation.</p>

<p>The inharmonious situation comes from some
inharmony within man himself.</p>

<p>When there is, in him, no emotional response to
an inharmonious situation, it fades away forever,
from his pathway.</p>

<p>So we see man’s work is ever with himself.</p>

<p>People have said to me, “Give treatments to
change my husband, or my brother.” I reply, “No,
I will give <em>treatments to change you</em>; when you
change, your husband and your brother will
change.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>One of my students was in the habit of lying. I
told her it was a failure method and if she lied, she
would be lied to. She replied, “I don’t care, I can’t
possibly get along without lying.”</p>

<p>One day she was speaking on the ’phone to a man
with whom she was very much in love. She turned to
me and said, “I don’t trust him, I know he’s lying to
me.” I replied, “Well, you lie yourself, so someone
has to lie to you, and you will be sure it will be just
the person you want the truth from.” Some time
after that, I saw her, and she said, “I’m cured of
lying.”</p>

<p>I questioned: “What cured you?”</p>

<p>She replied: “I have been living with a woman
who lied worse than I did!”</p>

<p>One is often cured of his faults by seeing them in
others.</p>

<p>Life is a mirror, and we find only ourselves
reflected in our associates.</p>

<p>Living in the past is a failure method and a
violation of spiritual law.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ said, “Behold, now is the accepted
time.” “Now is the day of Salvation.”</p>

<p>Lot’s wife looked back and was turned into a
pillar of salt.</p>

<p>The robbers of time are the past and the future.
Man should bless the past, and forget it, if it keeps
him in bondage, and bless the future, knowing it
has in store for him endless joys, but live <em>fully in the
now</em>.</p>

<p>For example: A woman came to me, complaining
that she had no money with which to buy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
Christmas gifts. She said, “Last year was so different;
I had plenty of money and gave lovely presents,
and this year I have scarcely a cent.”</p>

<p>I replied, “You will never demonstrate money
while you are pathetic and live in the past. Live
fully in the <em>now</em>, and <em>get ready to give Christmas
presents</em>. Dig your ditches, and the money will
come.” She exclaimed, “I know what to do! I will
buy some tinsel twine, Christmas seals and wrapping
paper.” I replied, “Do that, and the <em>presents
will come and stick themselves to the Christmas
seals</em>.”</p>

<p>This too, was showing financial fearlessness and
faith in God, as the reasoning mind said, “Keep
every cent you have, as you are not sure you will get
any more.”</p>

<p>She bought the seals, paper and twine, and a few
days before Christmas, received a gift of several
hundred dollars. Buying the seals and twine had
impressed the subconscious with expectancy, and
opened the way for the manifestation of the money.
She purchased all the presents in plenty of time.</p>

<p>Man must live suspended in the moment.</p>

<p>“Look well, therefore, to this Day! Such is the
salutation of the Dawn.”</p>

<p>He must be spiritually alert, ever awaiting his
leads, taking advantage of every opportunity.</p>

<p>One day, I said continually (silently), “Infinite
Spirit, don’t let me miss a trick,” and something
very important was told to me that evening. It is
most necessary to begin the day with right words.</p>

<p>Make an affirmation immediately upon waking.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>“<em>Thy will be done this day! Today is a day of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
completion; I give thanks for this perfect day,
miracle shall follow miracle and wonders shall
never cease.</em>”</p>

<p>Make this a habit, and one will see wonders and
miracles come into his life.</p>

<p>One morning I picked up a book and read,
“Look with wonder at that which is before you!” It
seemed to be my message for the day, so I repeated
again and again, “Look with wonder at that which
is before you.”</p>

<p>At about noon, a large sum of money, was given
me, which I had been desiring for a certain purpose.</p>

<p>In a following chapter, I will give affirmations
that I have found most effective. However, one
should never use an affirmation unless it is absolutely
satisfying and convincing to his own consciousness,
and often an affirmative is changed to
suit different people.</p>

<p>For example: The following has brought success
to many:</p>

<p>“I have a wonderful work, in a wonderful way, I
give wonderful service, for wonderful pay!”</p>

<p>I gave the first two lines to one of my students,
and she added the last two.</p>

<p>It made a <em>most powerful statement</em>, as there
should always be perfect payment for perfect service,
and a rhyme sinks easily into the subconscious.
She went about singing it aloud and soon
did receive wonderful work in a wonderful way,
and gave wonderful service for wonderful pay.</p>

<p>Another student, a business man, took it, and
changed the word work to business.</p>

<p>He repeated, “I have a wonderful business, in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
wonderful way, and I give wonderful service for
wonderful pay.” That afternoon he made a forty-one-thousand
dollar deal, though there had been
no activity in his affairs for months.</p>

<p>Every affirmation must be carefully worded and
completely “cover the ground.”</p>

<p>For example: I knew a woman, who was in great
need, and made a demand for work. She received a
great deal of work, but was never paid anything.
She now knows to add, “wonderful service for
wonderful pay.”</p>

<p>It is man’s divine right to have plenty! More than
enough!</p>

<p>“His barns should be full, and his cup should
flow over!” This is God’s idea for man, and when
man breaks down the barriers of lack in his own
consciousness, the Golden Age will be his, and
every righteous desire of his heart fulfilled!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_LAW_OF_KARMA">THE LAW OF KARMA<br><br>

<span class="fs90">and</span><br><br>

THE LAW OF FORGIVENESS</h2>
</div>


<p>Man receives only that which he gives. The
Game of Life is a game of boomerangs. Man’s
thoughts, deeds and words, return to him sooner or
later, with astounding accuracy.</p>

<p>This is the law of Karma, which is Sanskrit for
“Comeback.” “Whatsoever a man soweth, that
shall he also reap.”</p>

<p>For example: A friend told me this story of
herself, illustrating the law. She said, “I make all
my Karma on my aunt, whatever I say to her, some
one says to me. I am often irritable at home, and
one day, said to my aunt, who was talking to me
during dinner. ‘<em>No more talk, I wish to eat in
peace.</em>’”</p>

<p>“The following day, I was lunching with a
woman with whom I wished to make a great impression.
I was talking animatedly, when she said:
‘<em>No more talk, I wish to eat in peace!</em>’”</p>

<p>My friend is high in consciousness, so her Karma<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
returns much more quickly than to one on the
mental plane.</p>

<p>The more man knows, the more he is responsible
for, and a person with a knowledge of Spiritual
Law, which he does not practice, suffers greatly, in
consequence. “The fear of the Lord (law) is the
beginning of wisdom.” If we read the word Lord,
law, it will make many passages in the Bible much
clearer.</p>

<p>“Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord”
(law). It is the law which takes vengeance, not God.
God sees man perfect, “created in his own image,”
(imagination) and given “power and dominion.”</p>

<p>This is the perfect idea of man, registered in
Divine Mind, awaiting man’s recognition; for man
can only be what he sees himself to be, and only
attain what he sees himself attaining.</p>

<p>“Nothing ever happens without an on-looker” is
an ancient saying.</p>

<p>Man sees first his failure or success, his joy or
sorrow, before it swings into visibility from the
scenes set in his own imagination. We have observed
this in the mother picturing disease for her
child, or a woman seeing success for her husband.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ said, “And ye shall know the truth
and the truth shall make you free.”</p>

<p>So, we see freedom (from all unhappy conditions)
comes through knowledge—a knowledge of
Spiritual Law.</p>

<p>Obedience precedes authority, and the law obeys
man when he obeys the law. The law of electricity
must be obeyed before it becomes man’s servant.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
When handled ignorantly, it becomes man’s deadly
foe. <em>So with the laws of Mind!</em></p>

<p>For example: A woman with a strong personal
will, wished she owned a house which belonged to
an acquaintance, and she often made mental pictures
of herself living in the house. In the course of
time, the man died and she moved into the house.
Several years afterwards, coming into the knowledge
of Spiritual Law, she said to me: “Do you
think I had anything to do with that man’s death?”
I replied: “Yes, your desire was so strong, everything
made way for it, but you paid your Karmic
debt. Your husband, whom you loved devotedly,
died soon after, and the house was a white elephant
on your hands for years.”</p>

<p>The original owner, however, could not have
been affected by her thoughts had he been positive
in the truth, nor her husband, but they were both
under Karmic law. The woman should have said
(feeling the great desire for the house), “Infinite
Intelligence, give me the right house, equally as
charming as this, the house <em>which is mine by divine
right</em>.”</p>

<p>The divine selection would have given perfect
satisfaction and brought good to all. The divine
pattern is the only safe pattern to work by.</p>

<p><em>Desire is a tremendous force, and must be directed
in the right channels; or chaos ensues.</em></p>

<p>In demonstrating, the most important step is the
<em>first step, to “ask aright</em>.”</p>

<p>Man should always demand only that which is his
by <em>divine right</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>To go back to the illustration: Had the woman
taken this attitude: “If this house, I desire, is mine,
I cannot lose it, if it is not, give me its equivalent,”
the man might have decided to move out, harmoniously
(had it been the divine selection for her) or
another house would have been substituted. Anything
forced into manifestation through personal
will, is always “ill-got,” and has “ever bad success.”</p>

<p>Man is admonished, “My will be done not thine,
and the curious thing is, man always gets just what
he desires when he does relinquish personal will,
thereby enabling Infinite Intelligence to work
through him.”</p>

<p>“Stand ye still and see the salvation of the Lord”
(law).</p>

<p>For example: A woman came to me in great
distress. Her daughter had determined to take a
very hazardous trip, and the mother was filled with
fear.</p>

<p>She said she had used every argument, had
pointed out the dangers to be encountered, and
forbidden her to go, but the daughter became
more and more rebellious and determined. I said to
the mother, “You are forcing your personal will
upon your daughter, which you have no right to do,
and your fear of the trip is only attracting it, for
man attracts what he fears.” I added, “Let go, and
take your mental hands off; <em>put it in God’s Hands,
and use this statement</em>:” “I put this situation in the
hands of Infinite Love and Wisdom; if this trip is
the Divine plan, I bless it and no longer resist, but if
it is not divinely planned, I give thanks that it is now
dissolved and dissipated.” A day or two after that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
her daughter said to her, “Mother, I have given up
the trip,” and the situation returned to its “native
nothingness.”</p>

<p>It is learning to “stand still,” which seems so difficult
for man. I have dealt more fully with this
law in the chapter on nonresistance.</p>

<p>I will give another example of sowing and reaping,
which came in the most curious way.</p>

<p>A woman came to me saying, she had received a
counterfeit twenty-dollar bill, given to her at the
bank. She was much disturbed, for, she said, “The
people at the bank will never acknowledge their
mistake.”</p>

<p>I replied, “Let us analyze the situation and find
out why you attracted it.” She thought a few moments
and exclaimed: “I know it, I sent a friend a
lot of stagemoney, just for a joke.” So the law had
sent her some stagemoney, for it doesn’t know
anything about jokes.</p>

<p>I said, “Now we will call on the law of forgiveness,
and neutralize the situation.”</p>

<p>Christianity is founded upon the law of forgiveness—Christ
has redeemed us from the curse of the
Karmic law, and the Christ within each man is his
Redeemer and Salvation from all inharmonious
conditions.</p>

<p>So I said: “Infinite Spirit, we call on the law of
forgiveness and give thanks that she is under grace
and not under law, and cannot lose this twenty
dollars which is hers by divine right.”</p>

<p>“Now,” I said, “Go back to the bank and tell
them, fearlessly, that it was given you, there by
mistake.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>She obeyed, and to her surprise, they apologized
and gave her another bill, treating her most courteously.</p>

<p>So knowledge of the Law gives man power to
“rub out his mistakes.” Man cannot force the external
to be what he is not.</p>

<p>If he desires riches, he must be rich first in consciousness.</p>

<p>For example: A woman came to me asking treatment
for prosperity. She did not take much interest
in her household affairs, and her home was in great
disorder.</p>

<p>I said to her, “If you wish to be rich, you must be
orderly. All men with great wealth are orderly—and
order is heaven’s first law.” I added, “You will
never become rich with a burnt match in the pincushion.”</p>

<p>She had a good sense of humor and commenced
immediately, putting her house in order. She rearranged
furniture, straightened out bureau
drawers, cleaned rugs, and soon made a big financial
demonstration—a gift from a relative. The
woman, herself, became made over, and keeps
herself keyed-up financially, by being ever watchful
of the <em>external and expecting prosperity, knowing
God is her supply</em>.</p>

<p>Many people are in ignorance of the fact that
gifts and things are investments, and that hoarding
and saving invariably lead to loss.</p>

<p>“There is that scattereth and yet increaseth; and
there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it
tendeth to poverty.”</p>

<p>For example: I knew a man who wanted to buy a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
fur-lined overcoat. He and his wife went to various
shops, but there was none he wanted. He said they
were all too cheap-looking. At last, he was shown
one, the salesman said was valued at a thousand
dollars, but which the manager would sell him for
five-hundred dollars, as it was late in the season.</p>

<p>His financial possessions amounted to about
seven hundred dollars. The reasoning mind would
have said, “You can’t afford to spend nearly all you
have on a coat,” but he was very intuitive and never
reasoned.</p>

<p>He turned to his wife and said, “If I get this coat,
I’ll make a ton of money!” So his wife consented,
weakly.</p>

<p>About a month later, he received a ten-thousand-dollar
commission. The coat made him feel so
rich, it linked him with success and prosperity;
without the coat, he would not have received the
commission. It was an investment paying large
dividends!</p>

<p>If man ignores these leadings to spend or to give,
the same amount of money will go in an uninteresting
or unhappy way.</p>

<p>For example: A woman told me, on Thanksgiving
Day, she informed her family that they could
not afford a Thanksgiving dinner. She had the
money, but decided to save it.</p>

<p>A few days later, someone entered her room and
took from the bureau drawer the exact amount the
dinner would have cost.</p>

<p>The law always stands back of the man who
spends fearlessly, with wisdom.</p>

<p>For example: One of my students was shopping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
with her little nephew. The child clamored for a
toy, which she told him she could not afford to buy.</p>

<p>She realized suddenly that she was seeking lack,
and not recognizing God as her supply!</p>

<p>So she bought the toy, and on her way home,
picked <em>up, in the street, the exact amount of money
she had paid for it</em>.</p>

<p>Man’s supply is inexhaustible and unfailing
when fully trusted, but faith or trust must precede
the demonstration. “According to your faith be it
unto you.” “Faith is the substance of things hoped
for, the evidence of things not seen—” for faith
holds the vision steady, and the adverse pictures are
dissolved and dissipated, and “in due season we
shall reap, if we faint not.”</p>

<p>Jesus Christ brought the good news (the gospel)
that there was a higher law than the law of Karma—and
that that law transcends the law of Karma.
It is the law of grace, or forgiveness. It is the law
which <em>frees man from the law of cause and effect—the
law of consequence. “Under grace, and not
under law.”</em></p>

<p>We are told that on this plane, man reaps where
he has not sown; the gifts of God are simply poured
out upon him. “All that the Kingdom affords is
his.” This continued state of bliss awaits the man
who has overcome the race (or world) thought.</p>

<p>In the world thought there is tribulation, but
Jesus Christ said: “Be of good cheer; I have overcome
the world.”</p>

<p>The world thought is that of sin, sickness and
death. He saw their absolute unreality and said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
sickness and sorrow shall pass away and death
itself, the last enemy, be overcome.</p>

<p>We know now, from a scientific standpoint, that
death could be overcome by stamping the subconscious
mind with the conviction of eternal youth
and eternal life.</p>

<p>The subconscious, being simply power without
direction, <em>carries out orders without questioning</em>.</p>

<p>Working under the direction of the superconscious
(the Christ or God within man) the “resurrection
of the body” would be accomplished.</p>

<p>Man would no longer throw off his body in
death, it would be transformed into the “body
electric,” sung by Walt Whitman, for Christianity
is founded upon the forgiveness of sins and “an
empty tomb.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CASTING_THE_BURDEN">CASTING THE BURDEN<br><br>
Impressing the Subconscious</h2>
</div>


<p>When man knows his own powers and the workings
of his mind, his great desire is to find an easy
and quick way to impress the subconscious with
good, for simply an intellectual knowledge of the
Truth will not bring results.</p>

<p>In my own case, I found the easiest way is in
“casting the burden.”</p>

<p>A metaphysician once explained it in this manner.
He said, “The only thing which gives anything
weight in nature, is the law of gravitation, and if a
boulder could be taken high above the planet,
there would be no weight in that boulder; and that
is what Jesus Christ meant when he said: ‘My yoke
is easy and my burden is light.’”</p>

<p>He had overcome the world vibration, and functioned
in the fourth dimensional realm, where
there is only perfection, completion, life and joy.</p>

<p>He said: “Come to me all ye that labor and are
heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” “Take my
yoke upon you, for my yoke is easy and my burden
is light.”</p>

<p>We are also told in the fifty-fifth Psalm, to “cast
thy burden upon the Lord.” Many passages in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
Bible state that the <em>battle is God’s</em> not man’s and
that man is always to <em>“stand still” and see the
Salvation of the Lord</em>.</p>

<p>This indicates that the superconscious mind (or
Christ within) is the department which fights man’s
battle and relieves him of burdens.</p>

<p>We see, therefore, that man violates law if he
carries a burden, and a burden is an adverse
thought or condition, and this thought or condition
has its root in the subconscious.</p>

<p>It seems almost impossible to make any headway
directing the subconscious from the conscious, or
reasoning mind, as the reasoning mind (the intellect)
is limited in its conceptions, and filled with
doubts and fears.</p>

<p>How scientific it then is, to cast the burden upon
the superconscious mind (or Christ within) where
it is “made light,” or dissolved into its “native
nothingness.”</p>

<p>For example: A woman in urgent need of money,
“made light” upon the Christ within, the superconscious,
with the statement, “I cast this burden of
lack on the Christ (within) and I go free to have
plenty!”</p>

<p>The belief in lack was her burden, and as she cast
it upon the Superconscious with its belief of plenty,
an avalanche of supply was the result.</p>

<p>We read, “The Christ in you the hope of glory.”</p>

<p>Another example: One of my students had been
given a new piano, and there was no room in her
studio for it until she had moved out the old one.
She was in a state of perplexity. She wanted to keep
the old piano, but knew of no place to send it. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
became desperate, as the new piano was to be sent
immediately; in fact, was on its way, with no place
to put it. She said it came to her to repeat, “I cast
this burden on the Christ within, and I go free.”</p>

<p>A few moments later, her ’phone rang, and a
woman friend asked if she might rent her old
piano, and it was moved out, a few minutes before
the new one arrived.</p>

<p>I knew a woman, whose burden was resentment.
She said, “I cast this burden of resentment on the
Christ within, and I go free, to be loving, harmonious
and happy.” The Almighty superconscious,
flooded the subconscious with love, and her whole
life was changed. For years, resentment had held
her in a state of torment and imprisoned her soul
(the subconscious mind).</p>

<p>The statement should be made over and over
and over, sometimes for hours at a time, silently or
audibly, with quietness but determination.</p>

<p>I have often compared it to winding-up a victrola.
We must wind ourselves up with spoken words.</p>

<p>I have noticed, in “casting the burden,” after a
little while, one seems to see clearly. It is impossible
to have clear vision, while in the throes of carnal
mind. Doubts and fear poison the mind and body
and imagination runs riot, attracting disaster and
disease.</p>

<p>In steadily repeating the affirmation, “I cast this
burden on the Christ within, and go free,” the
vision clears, and with it a feeling of relief, and
sooner or later comes <em>the manifestation of good, be
it health, happiness or supply</em>.</p>

<p>One of my students once asked me to explain the
“darkness before the dawn.” I referred in a preceding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
chapter to the fact that often, before the big
demonstration “everything seems to go wrong,”
and deep depression clouds the consciousness. It
means that out of the subconscious are rising the
doubts and fears of the ages. These old derelicts of
the subconscious rise to the surface, <em>to be put out</em>.</p>

<p>It is then, that man should clap his cymbals, like
Jehoshaphat, and give thanks that he is saved, even
though he seems surrounded by the enemy (the
situation of lack or disease). The student continued,
“How long must one remain in the dark” and I
replied, “until one <em>can see in the dark</em>,” and “<em>casting
the burden enables one to see in the dark</em>.”</p>

<p>In order to impress the subconscious, active faith
is always essential.</p>

<p>“Faith without works is dead.” In these chapters
I have endeavored to bring out this point.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ showed active faith when “He commanded
the multitude to sit down on the ground,”
before he gave thanks for the loaves and the fishes.</p>

<p>I will give another example showing how necessary
this step is. In fact, active faith is the bridge,
over which man passes to his Promised Land.</p>

<p>Through misunderstanding, a woman had been
separated from her husband, whom she loved
deeply. He refused all offers of reconciliation and
would not communicate with her in any way.</p>

<p>Coming into the knowledge of Spiritual law, she
denied the appearance of separation. She made
this statement: “There is no separation in Divine
Mind, therefore, I cannot be separated from the
love and companionship which are mine by divine
right.”</p>

<p>She showed active faith by arranging a place for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
him at the table every day; thereby impressing the
subconscious with a picture of his <em>return</em>. Over a
year passed, but she never wavered, and <em>one day he
walked in</em>.</p>

<p>The subconscious is often impressed through
music. Music has a fourth dimensional quality and
releases the soul from imprisonment. It makes
wonderful things seem <em>possible, and easy of accomplishment</em>!</p>

<p>I have a friend who uses her victrola, daily, for
this purpose. It puts her in perfect harmony and
releases the imagination.</p>

<p>Another woman often dances while making her
affirmations. The rhythm and harmony of music
and motion carry her words forth with tremendous
power.</p>

<p>The student must remember also, not to despise
the “day of small things.”</p>

<p>Invariably, before a demonstration, come “signs
of land.”</p>

<p>Before Columbus reached America, he saw birds
and twigs which showed him land was near. So it is
with a demonstration; but often the student mistakes
it for the demonstration itself, and is disappointed.</p>

<p>For example: A woman had “spoken the word”
for a set of dishes. Not long afterwards a friend gave
her a dish which was old and cracked.</p>

<p>She came to me and said, “Well, I asked for a set
of dishes, and all I got was a cracked plate.”</p>

<p>I replied, “The plate was only signs of land. It
shows your dishes are coming—look upon it as
birds and seaweed,” and not long afterwards the
dishes came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>Continually “making-believe,” impresses the
subconscious. If one makes believe he is rich, and
makes believe he is successful, in “due time he will
reap.”</p>

<p>Children are always “making believe,” and “except
ye be converted, and become as little children,
ye shall not enter the Kingdom of Heaven.”</p>

<p>For example: I know of a woman who was very
poor, but no one could make her <em>feel poor</em>. She
earned a small amount of money from rich friends,
who constantly reminded her of her poverty, and to
be careful and saving. Regardless of their admonitions,
she would spend all her earnings on a hat, or
make someone a gift, and be in a rapturous state of
mind. Her thoughts were always centered on beautiful
clothes and “rings and things,” but without
envying others.</p>

<p>She lived in the world of the wondrous, and only
riches seemed real to her. Before long she married a
rich man, and the rings and things became visible.
I do not know whether the man was the “Divine
Selection,” but opulence had to manifest in her
life, as she had imaged only opulence.</p>

<p>There is no peace or happiness for man, until he
has erased all fear from the subconscious.</p>

<p>Fear is misdirected energy and must be redirected,
or transmuted into Faith.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ said, “Why are ye fearful, O ye of
little faith?” “All things are possible to him that
believeth.”</p>

<p>I am asked, so often by my students, “<em>How can I
get rid of fear?</em>”</p>

<p>I reply, “<em>By walking up to the thing you are
afraid of</em>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>“The lion takes its fierceness from your fear.”</p>

<p>Walk up to the lion, and he will disappear; run
away and he runs after you.</p>

<p>I have shown in previous chapters, how the lion
of lack disappeared when the individual spent
money fearlessly, showing faith that God was his
supply and therefore, unfailing.</p>

<p>Many of my students have come out of the
bondage of poverty, and are now bountifully supplied,
through losing all fear of letting money go
out. The subconscious is impressed with the truth
that <em>God is the Giver and the Gift</em>; therefore as one
is one with the Giver, he is one with the Gift. A
splendid statement is, “I now thank God the Giver
for God the Gift.”</p>

<p>Man has so long separated himself from his good
and his supply, through thoughts of separation and
lack, that sometimes, it takes dynamite to dislodge
these false ideas from the subconscious, and the
dynamite is a big situation.</p>

<p>We see in the foregoing illustration, how the
individual was freed from his bondage by <em>showing
fearlessness</em>.</p>

<p>Man should watch himself hourly to detect if his
motive for action is fear or faith.</p>

<p>“Choose ye this day whom we shall serve,” fear or
faith.</p>

<p>Perhaps one’s fear is of personality. Then do not
avoid the people feared; be willing to meet them
cheerfully, and they will either prove “golden links
in the chain of one’s good,” or disappear harmoniously
from one’s pathway.</p>

<p>Perhaps one’s fear is of disease or germs. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
one should be fearless and undisturbed in a germ-laden
situation, and he would be immune.</p>

<p>One can only contract germs while vibrating at
the same rate as the germ, and fear drags men
down to the level of the germ. Of course, the disease
laden germ is the product of carnal mind, as all
thought must objectify. Germs do not exist in the
superconscious or Divine Mind, therefore are the
product of man’s “vain imagination.”</p>

<p>“In the twinkling of an eye,” man’s release will
come when he realizes <em>there is no power in evil</em>.</p>

<p>The material world will fade away, and the
fourth dimensional world, the “World of the Wondrous,”
will swing into manifestation.</p>

<p>“And I saw a new heaven, and a new earth—and
there shall be no more death, neither sorrow nor
crying, neither shall there be any more pain; for the
former things are passed away.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="LOVE">LOVE</h2>
</div>


<p>Every man on this planet is taking his initiation
in love. “A new commandment I give unto you,
that ye love one another.” Ouspensky states, in
“Tertium Organum,” that “love is a cosmic phenomenon,”
and opens to man the fourth dimensional
world, “The World of the Wondrous.”</p>

<p>Real love is selfless and free from fear. It pours
itself out upon the object of its affection, without
demanding any return. Its joy is in the joy of giving.
Love is God in manifestation, and the strongest
magnetic force in the universe. Pure, unselfish love
<em>draws to itself its own</em>; it does not need to seek or
demand. Scarcely anyone has the faintest conception
of real love. Man is selfish, tyrannical or fearful
in his affections, thereby losing the thing he
loves. Jealousy is the worst enemy of love, for the
imagination runs riot, seeing the loved one attracted
to another, and invariably these fears
objectify if they are not neutralized.</p>

<p>For example: A woman came to me in deep distress.
The man she loved had left her for other
women, and said he never intended to marry her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
She was torn with jealousy and resentment and said
she hoped he would suffer as he had made her
suffer; and added, “How could he leave me when I
loved him so much?”</p>

<p>I replied, “You are not loving that man, you are
hating him,” and added, “<em>You can never receive
what you have never given. Give a perfect love and
you will receive a perfect love.</em> Perfect yourself on
this man. Give him a perfect, <em>unselfish</em> love, demanding
nothing in return, do not criticise or
condemn, and <em>bless him wherever he is</em>.”</p>

<p>She replied, “No, I won’t bless him unless I know
where he is!”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “that is not real love.”</p>

<p>“When you <em>send out real love</em>, real love will return
to you, either from this man or his equivalent,
for if this man is not the divine selection, you will
not want him. As you are one with God, you are one
with the love which belongs to you by divine right.”</p>

<p>Several months passed, and matters remained
about the same, but she was working conscientiously
with herself. I said, “When you are no longer
disturbed by his cruelty, he will cease to be cruel, as
you are attracting it through your own emotions.”</p>

<p>Then I told her of a brotherhood in India, who
never said, “Good morning” to each other. They
used these words: “<em>I salute the Divinity in you.</em>”
They saluted the divinity in every man, and in the
wild animals in the jungle, and they were never
harmed, for they <em>saw only God in every</em> living
thing. I said, “Salute the divinity in this man, and
say, ‘I see your divine self only. I see you as God sees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
you, perfect, made in His image and likeness.’”</p>

<p>She found she was becoming more poised, and
gradually losing her resentment. He was a Captain,
and she always called him “The Cap.”</p>

<p>One day, she said, suddenly, “<em>God bless the Cap
wherever he is.</em>”</p>

<p>I replied: “Now, that is real love, and when you
have become a ‘complete circle,’ and are no longer
disturbed by the situation, you will have his love, or
attract its equivalent.”</p>

<p>I was moving at this time, and did not have a
telephone, so was out of touch with her for a few
weeks, when one morning I received a letter saying,
“We are married.”</p>

<p>At the earliest opportunity, I paid her a call. My
first words were, “What happened?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” she exclaimed, “a miracle! One day I woke
up and all suffering had ceased. I saw him that
evening and he asked me to marry him. We were
married in about a week, and I have never seen a
more devoted man.”</p>

<p>There is an old saying: “<em>No man is your enemy,
no man is your friend, every man is your teacher.</em>”</p>

<p>So one should become impersonal and learn
what each man has to teach him, and soon he
would learn his lessons and be free.</p>

<p>The woman’s lover was teaching her selfless love,
which every man, sooner or later, must learn.</p>

<p>Suffering is not necessary for man’s development;
it is the result of violation of spiritual law,
but few people seem able to rouse themselves from
their “soul sleep” without it. When people are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
happy, they usually become selfish, and automatically
the law of Karma is set in action. Man
often suffers loss through lack of appreciation.</p>

<p>I knew a woman who had a very nice husband,
but she said often, “I don’t care anything about
being married, but that is nothing against my
husband. I’m simply not interested in married
life.”</p>

<p>She had other interests, and scarcely remembered
she had a husband. She only thought of him
when she saw him. One day her husband told her
he was in love with another woman, and left. She
came to me in distress and resentment.</p>

<p>I replied, “It is exactly what you spoke the word
for. You said you didn’t care anything about being
married, so the subconscious worked to get you
unmarried.”</p>

<p>She said, “Oh yes, I see. People get what they
want, and then feel very much hurt.”</p>

<p>She soon became in perfect harmony with the
situation, and knew they were both much happier
apart.</p>

<p>When a woman becomes indifferent or critical,
and ceases to be an inspiration to her husband, he
misses the stimulus of their early relationship and is
restless and unhappy.</p>

<p>A man came to me dejected, miserable and
poor. His wife was interested in the “Science of
Numbers,” and had had him read. It seems the
report was not very favorable, for he said, “My wife
says I’ll never amount to anything because I am a
two.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>I replied, “I don’t care what your number is, you
are a perfect idea in divine mind, and we will
demand the success and prosperity which are <em>already
planned</em> for you by that Infinite Intelligence.”</p>

<p>Within a few weeks, he had a very fine position,
and a year or two later, he achieved a brilliant
success as a writer. No man is a success in business
unless he loves his work. The picture the artist
paints for love (of his art) is his greatest work. The
pot-boiler is always something to live down.</p>

<p>No man can attract money if he despises it. Many
people are kept in poverty by saying: “Money
means nothing to me, and I have a contempt for
people who have it.”</p>

<p>This is the reason so many artists are poor. Their
contempt for money separates them from it.</p>

<p>I remember hearing one artist say of another,
“He’s no good as an artist, he has money in the
bank.”</p>

<p>This attitude of mind, of course, separates man
from his supply; he must be in harmony with a
thing in order to attract it.</p>

<p>Money is God in manifestation, as freedom from
want and limitation, but it must be always kept in
circulation and put to right uses. Hoarding and
saving react with grim vengeance.</p>

<p>This does not mean that man should not have
houses and lots, stocks and bonds, for “the barns
of the righteous man shall be full.” It means man
should not hoard even the principal, if an occasion
arises, when money is necessary. In letting it go out
fearlessly and cheerfully he opens the way for more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
to come in, for God is man’s unfailing and inexhaustible
supply.</p>

<p>This is the spiritual attitude towards money and
the great Bank of the Universal never fails!</p>

<p>We see an example of hoarding in the film
production of “Greed.” The woman won five thousand
dollars in a lottery, but would not spend it.
She hoarded and saved, let her husband suffer and
starve, and eventually she scrubbed floors for a
living.</p>

<p>She loved the money itself and put it above
everything, and one night she was murdered and
the money taken from her.</p>

<p>This is an example of where “love of money is the
root of all evil.” Money in itself, is good and beneficial,
but used for destructive purposes, hoarded
and saved, or considered more important than
love, brings disease and disaster, and the loss of the
money itself.</p>

<p>Follow the path of love, and all things are added,
<em>for God is love</em>, and <em>God is supply</em>; follow the path
of selfishness and greed, and the supply vanishes, or
man is separated from it.</p>

<p>For example; I knew the case of a very rich
woman, who hoarded her income. She rarely gave
anything away, but bought and bought and bought
things for herself.</p>

<p>She was very fond of necklaces, and a friend once
asked her how many she possessed. She replied,
“Sixty-seven.” She bought them and put them
away, carefully wrapped in tissue paper. Had she
used the necklaces it would have been quite legitimate,
but she was violating “the law of use.” Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
closets were filled with clothes she never wore, and
jewels which never saw the light.</p>

<p>The woman’s arms were gradually becoming
paralyzed from holding on to things, and eventually
she was considered incapable of looking after her
affairs and her wealth was handed over to others to
manage.</p>

<p>So man, in ignorance of the law, brings about his
own destruction.</p>

<p>All disease, all unhappiness, come from the violation
of the law of love. Man’s boomerangs of hate,
resentment and criticism, come back laden with
sickness and sorrow. Love seems almost a lost art,
but the man with the knowledge of spiritual law
knows it must be regained, for without it, he has
“become as sounding brass and tinkling cymbals.”</p>

<p>For example: I had a student who came to me,
month after month, to clean her consciousness of
resentment. After a while, she arrived at the point
where she resented only one woman, but that one
woman kept her busy. Little by little she became
poised and harmonious, and one day, all resentment
was wiped out.</p>

<p>She came in radiant, and exclaimed “You can’t
understand how I feel! The woman said something
to me and instead of being furious I was loving and
kind, and she apologized and was perfectly lovely to
me.</p>

<p>No one can understand the marvelous lightness I
feel within!”</p>

<p>Love and good-will are invaluable in business.</p>

<p>For example: A woman came to me, complaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
of her employer. She said she was cold and
critical and knew she did not want her in the
position.</p>

<p>“Well,” I replied, “Salute the Divinity in the
woman and send her love.”</p>

<p>She said “I can’t; she’s a marble woman.”</p>

<p>I answered, “You remember the story of the
sculptor who asked for a certain piece of marble.
He was asked why he wanted it, and he replied,
‘because there is an angel in the marble,’ and out of
it he produced a wonderful work of art.”</p>

<p>She said, “Very well, I’ll try it.” A week later she
came back and said, “I did what you told me to,
and now the woman is very kind, and took me out
in her car.”</p>

<p>People are sometimes filled with remorse for
having done someone an unkindness, perhaps years
ago.</p>

<p>If the wrong cannot be righted, its effect can be
neutralized by doing some one a kindness <em>in the
present</em>.</p>

<p>“This one thing I do, forgetting those things
which are behind and reaching forth unto those
things which are before.”</p>

<p>Sorrow, regret and remorse tear down the cells of
the body, and poison the atmosphere of the individual.</p>

<p>A woman said to me in deep sorrow, “Treat me
to be happy and joyous, for my sorrow makes me so
irritable with the members of my family that I keep
making more Karma.”</p>

<p>I was asked to treat a woman who was mourning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
for her daughter. I denied all belief in loss and
separation, and affirmed that God was the woman’s
joy, love and peace.</p>

<p>The woman gained her poise at once, but sent
word by her son, not to treat any longer, because
she was “so happy, it wasn’t respectable.”</p>

<p>So “mortal mind” loves to hang on to its griefs
and regrets.</p>

<p>I knew a woman who went about bragging of her
troubles, so, of course, she always had something to
brag about.</p>

<p>The old idea was if a woman did not worry about
her children, she was not a good mother.</p>

<p>Now, we know that mother-fear is responsible
for many of the diseases and accidents which come
into the lives of children.</p>

<p>For fear pictures vividly the disease or situation
feared, and these pictures objectify, if not neutralized.</p>

<p>Happy is the mother who can say sincerely, that
she puts her child in God’s hands, and <em>knows</em> therefore,
that he is divinely protected.</p>

<p>For example: A woman awoke suddenly, in the
night, feeling her brother was in great danger.
Instead of giving in to her fears, she commenced
making statements of Truth, saying, “Man is a
perfect idea in Divine Mind, and is always in his
right place, therefore, my brother is in his right
place, and is divinely protected.”</p>

<p>The next day she found that her brother had
been in close proximity to an explosion in a mine,
but had miraculously escaped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>So man is his brother’s keeper (in thought) and
every man should know that the thing he loves
dwells in “the secret place of the most high, and
abides under the shadow of the Almighty.”</p>

<p>“There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any
plague come nigh thy dwelling.”</p>

<p>“Perfect love casteth out fear. He that feareth is
not made perfect in love,” and “Love is the fulfilling
of the Law.”</p>

<p>There is nothing too great of accomplishment
for the man who knows the power of his word, and
who follows his intuitive leads. By the word he starts
in action unseen forces and can rebuild his body or
remold his affairs.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, of the utmost importance to
choose the right words, and the student carefully
selects the affirmation he wishes to catapult into
the invisible.</p>

<p>He knows that God is his supply, that there is a
supply for every demand, and that his spoken word
releases this supply.</p>

<p>“Ask and ye shall receive.”</p>

<p>Man must make the first move. “Draw nigh to
God and He will draw nigh to you.”</p>

<p>I have often been asked just how to make a
demonstration.</p>

<p>I reply: “Speak the word and then do not do
anything until you get a definite lead.” Demand
the lead, saying, “Infinite Spirit, reveal to me the
way, let me know if there is anything for me to do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>The answer will come through intuition (or
hunch); a chance remark from someone, or a
passage in a book, etc., etc. The answers are
sometimes quite startling in their exactness. For
example: A woman desired a large sum of money.
She spoke the words: “Infinite Spirit, open the way
for my immediate supply, let all that is mine by
divine right now reach me, in great avalanches of
abundance.” Then she added: “Give me a definite
lead, let me know if there is anything for me to do.”</p>

<p>The thought came quickly, “Give a certain
friend” (who had helped her spiritually) “a hundred
dollars.” She told her friend, who said, “Wait
and get another lead, before giving it.” So she
waited, and that day met a woman who said to her,
“I gave someone a dollar today; it was just as much
for me, as it would be for you to give someone a
hundred.”</p>

<p>This was indeed an unmistakable lead, so she
knew she was right in giving the hundred dollars.
It was a gift which proved a great investment, for
shortly after that, a large sum of money came to her
in a remarkable way.</p>

<p>Giving opens the way for receiving. In order to
create activity in finances, one should give. Tithing
or giving one-tenth of one’s income, is an old Jewish
custom, and is sure to bring increase. Many of the
richest men in this country have been tithers, and I
have never known it to fail as an investment.</p>

<p>The tenth-part goes forth and returns blessed
and multiplied. But the gift or tithe must be given
with love and cheerfulness, for “God loveth a cheerful
giver.” Bills should be paid cheerfully; all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
money should be sent forth fearlessly and with a
blessing.</p>

<p>This attitude of mind makes man master of
money. It is his to obey, and his spoken word then
opens vast reservoirs of wealth.</p>

<p>Man, himself, limits his supply by his limited
vision. Sometimes the student has a great realization
of wealth, but is afraid to act.</p>

<p>The vision and action must go hand in hand, as
in the case of the man who bought the fur-lined
overcoat.</p>

<p>A woman came to me asking me to “speak the
word” for a position. So I demanded: “Infinite
Spirit, open the way for this woman’s right position.”
Never ask for just “a position”; ask for the
right position, the place already planned in Divine
Mind, as it is the only one that will give satisfaction.</p>

<p>I then gave thanks that she had already received,
and that it would manifest quickly. Very soon, she
had three positions offered her, two in New York
and one in Palm Beach, and she did not know
which to choose. I said, “Ask for a definite lead.”</p>

<p>The time was almost up and was still undecided,
when one day, she telephoned, “When I woke up
this morning, I could smell Palm Beach.” She had
been there before and knew its balmy fragrance.</p>

<p>I replied: “Well, if you can smell Palm Beach
from here, it is certainly your lead.” She accepted
the position, and it proved a great success. Often
one’s lead comes at an unexpected time.</p>

<p>One day, I was walking down the street, when I
suddenly felt a strong urge to go to a certain
bakery, a block or two away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>The reasoning mind resisted, arguing, “There is
nothing there that you want.”</p>

<p>However, I had learned not to reason, so I went
to the bakery, looked at everything, and there was
certainly nothing there that I wanted, but coming
out I encountered a woman I had thought of often,
and who was in great need of the help which I could
give her.</p>

<p>So often, one goes for one thing and finds another.</p>

<p>Intuition is a spiritual faculty and does not explain,
but simply <em>points the way</em>.</p>

<p>A person often receives a lead during a “treatment.”
The idea that comes may seem quite irrelevant,
but some of God’s leadings are “mysterious.”</p>

<p>In the class, one day, I was treating that each
individual would receive a definite lead. A woman
came to me afterwards, and said: “While you were
treating, I got the hunch to take my furniture out of
storage and get an apartment.” The woman had
come to be treated for health. I told her I knew in
getting a home of her own, her health would
improve, and I added, “I believe your trouble,
which is a congestion, has come from having things
stored away. Congestion of things causes congestion
in the body. You have violated the law of use,
and your body is paying the penalty.”</p>

<p>So I gave thanks that “<em>Divine order was established
in her mind, body and affairs</em>.”</p>

<p>People little dream of how their affairs react on
the body. There is a mental correspondence for
every disease. A person might receive instantaneous
healing through the realization of his body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
being a perfect idea in Divine Mind, and, therefore,
whole and perfect, but if he continues his
destructive thinking, hoarding, hating, fearing,
condemning, the disease will return.</p>

<p>Jesus Christ knew that all sickness came from
sin, but admonished the leper after the healing, to
go and sin no more, lest a worse thing come upon
him.</p>

<p>So man’s soul (or subconscious mind) must be
washed whiter than snow, for permanent healing;
and the metaphysician is always delving deep for
the “correspondence.”</p>

<p>Jesus Christ said, “Condemn not lest ye also be
condemned.”</p>

<p>“Judge not, lest ye be judged.”</p>

<p>Many people have attracted disease and unhappiness
through condemnation of others.</p>

<p>What man condemns in others, he attracts to
himself.</p>

<p>For example: A friend came to me in anger and
distress, because her husband had deserted her for
another woman. She condemned the other woman,
and said continually, “She knew he was a
married man, and had no right to accept his
attentions.”</p>

<p>I replied, “Stop condemning the woman, bless
her, and be through with the situation, otherwise,
you are attracting the same thing to yourself.”</p>

<p>She was deaf to my words, and a year or two
later, became deeply interested in a married man,
herself.</p>

<p>Man picks up a live-wire whenever he criticises
or condemns, and may expect a shock.</p>

<p>Indecision is a stumbling-block in many a pathway.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
In order to overcome it, make the statement,
repeatedly, “<em>I am always under direct inspiration;
I make right decisions, quickly.</em>”</p>

<p>These words impress the subconscious, and soon
one finds himself awake and alert, making his
right moves without hesitation. I have found it
destructive to look to the psychic plane for guidance,
as it is the plane of many minds and not
“The One Mind.”</p>

<p>As man opens his mind to subjectivity, he becomes
a target for destructive forces. The psychic
plane is the result of man’s mortal thought, and is
on the “plane of opposites.” He may receive either
good or bad messages.</p>

<p>The science of numbers and the reading of
horoscopes, keep man down on the mental (or
mortal) plane, for they deal only with the Karmic
path.</p>

<p>I know of a man who should have been dead,
years ago, according to his horoscope, but he is
alive and a leader of one of the biggest movements
in this country for the uplift of humanity.</p>

<p>It takes a very strong mind to neutralize a prophecy
of evil. The student should declare, “Every
false prophecy shall come to naught; every plan
my Father in heaven has not planned, shall be dissolved
and dissipated, the divine idea now comes
to pass.”</p>

<p>However, if any good message has ever been
given one, of coming happiness, or wealth, harbor
and expect it, and it will manifest sooner or later,
through the law of expectancy.</p>

<p>Man’s will should be used to back the universal
will. “I will that the will of God be done.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>It is God’s will to give every man, every righteous
desire of his heart, and man’s will should be
used to hold the perfect vision, without wavering.</p>

<p>The prodigal son said: “I will arise and go to my
Father.”</p>

<p>It is, indeed, often an effort of the will to leave
the husks and swine of mortal thinking. It is so
much easier, for the average person, to have fear
than faith; <em>so faith is an effort of the will</em>.</p>

<p>As man becomes spiritually awakened he recognizes
that any external inharmony is the correspondence
of mental inharmony. If he stumbles or
falls, he may know he is stumbling or falling in
consciousness.</p>

<p>One day, a student was walking along the street
condemning someone in her thoughts. She was
saying, mentally, “That woman is the most disagreeable
woman on earth,” when suddenly three
boy scouts rushed around the corner and almost
knocked her over. She did not condemn the boy
scouts, but immediately called on the law of forgiveness,
and “saluted the divinity” in the woman.
Wisdom’s ways are ways of pleasantness and all her
paths are peace.</p>

<p>When one has made his demands upon the
Universal, he must be ready for surprises. Everything
may seem to be going wrong, when in reality,
it is going right.</p>

<p>For example: A woman was told that there was
no loss in divine mind, therefore, she could not
lose anything which belonged to her; anything
lost, would be returned, or she would receive its
equivalent.</p>

<p>Several years previously, she had lost two thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
dollars. She had loaned the money to a relative
during her lifetime, but the relative had died,
leaving no mention of it in her will. The woman
was resentful and angry, and as she had no written
statement of the transaction, she never received
the money, so she determined to deny the loss, and
collect the two thousand dollars from the Bank of
the Universal. She had to begin by forgiving the
woman, as resentment and unforgiveness close the
doors of this wonderful bank.</p>

<p>She made this statement, “I deny loss, there is
no loss in Divine Mind, therefore, I cannot lose the
two thousand dollars, which belong to me by divine
right.” “<em>As one door shuts another door
opens.</em>”</p>

<p>She was living in an apartment house which was
for sale; and in the lease was a clause, stating that
if the house was sold, the tenants would be required
to move out within ninety days.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the landlord broke the leases and
raised the rent. Again, injustice was on her pathway,
but this time she was undisturbed. She
blessed the landlord, and said, “As the rent has
been raised, it means that I’ll be that much richer,
for God is my supply.”</p>

<p>New leases were made out for the advanced
rent, but by some divine mistake, the ninety days
clause had been forgotten. Soon after, the landlord
had an opportunity to sell the house. On
account of the mistake in the new leases, the tenants
held possession for another year.</p>

<p>The agent offered each tenant two hundred
dollars if he would vacate. Several families moved;
three remained, including the woman. A month<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
or two passed, and the agent again appeared. This
time he said to the woman, “Will you break your
lease for the sum of fifteen hundred dollars?” It
flashed upon her, “Here comes the two thousand
dollars.” She remembered having said to friends
in the house, “We will all act together if anything
more is said about leaving.” So her <em>lead</em> was to
consult her friends.</p>

<p>These friends said: “Well, if they have offered
you fifteen hundred they will certainly give two
thousand.” So she received a check for two thousand
dollars for giving up the apartment. It was
certainly a remarkable working of the law, and
the apparent injustice was merely opening the way
for her demonstration.</p>

<p>It proved that there is no loss, and when man
takes his spiritual stand, he collects all that is his
from this great Reservoir of Good.</p>

<p>“I will restore to you the years the locusts have
eaten.”</p>

<p>The locusts are the doubts, fears, resentments
and regrets of mortal thinking.</p>

<p>These adverse thoughts, alone, rob man; for
“No man gives to himself but himself, and no man
takes away from himself, but himself.”</p>

<p>Man is here to prove God and “to bear witness
to the truth,” and he can only prove God by
bringing plenty out of lack, and justice out of
injustice.</p>

<p>“Prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of
hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven,
and pour out a blessing, that there shall not be
room enough to receive it.”</p>

THE DIVINE DESIGN</h2>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“No wind can drive my bark astray</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">nor change the tide of destiny.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>There is for each man, perfect self-expression.
There is a place which he is to fill and no one else
can fill, something which he is to do, which no one
else can do; it is his destiny!</p>

<p>This achievement is held, a perfect idea in Divine
Mind, awaiting man’s recognition. As the
imaging faculty is the creative faculty, it is necessary
for man to see the idea, before it can manifest.</p>

<p>So man’s highest demand is for the <em>Divine Design
of his life</em>.</p>

<p>He may not have the faintest conception of
what it is, for there is, possibly, some marvelous
talent, hidden deep within him.</p>

<p>His demand should be: “<em>Infinite Spirit, open
the way for the Divine Design of my life to manifest;
let the genius within me now be released; let
me see clearly the perfect plan.</em>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>The perfect plan includes health, wealth, love
and perfect self-expression. This is the <em>square of
life</em>, which brings perfect happiness. When one
has made this demand, he may find great changes
taking place in his life, for nearly every man has
wandered far from the Divine Design.</p>

<p>I know, in one woman’s case, it was as though a
cyclone had struck her affairs, but readjustments
came quickly, and new and wonderful conditions
took the place of old ones.</p>

<p>Perfect self-expression will never be labor; but
of such absorbing interest that it will seem almost
like play. The student knows, also, as man comes
into the world financed by God, the <em>supply</em> needed
for his perfect self-expression will be at hand.</p>

<p>Many a genius has struggled for years with the
problem of supply, when his spoken word, and
faith, would have released quickly, the necessary
funds.</p>

<p>For example: After the class, one day, a man
came to me and handed me a cent.</p>

<p>He said: “I have just seven cents in the world,
and I’m going to give you one; for I have faith in
the power of your spoken word. I want you to
speak the word for my perfect self-expression and
prosperity.”</p>

<p>I “spoke the word,” and did not see him again
until a year later. He came in one day, successful
and happy, with a roll of yellow bills in his pocket.
He said, “Immediately after you spoke the word, I
had a position offered me in a distant city, and am
now demonstrating health, happiness and supply.”</p>

<p>A woman’s perfect self-expression may be in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
becoming a perfect wife, a perfect mother, a perfect
home-maker and not necessarily in having a
public career.</p>

<p>Demand definite leads, and the way will be
made easy and successful.</p>

<p>One should not visualize or force a mental picture.
When he demands the Divine Design to
come into his conscious mind, he will receive
flashes of inspiration, and begin to see himself
making some great accomplishment. This is the
picture, or idea, he must hold without wavering.</p>

<p>The thing man seeks is seeking him—<em>the telephone
was seeking Bell</em>!</p>

<p>Parents should never force careers and professions
upon their children. With a knowledge of
spiritual Truth, the Divine Plan could be spoken
for, early in childhood, or prenatally.</p>

<p>A prenatal treatment should be: “Let the God
in this child have perfect expression; let the Divine
Design of his mind, body and affairs be made
manifest throughout his life, throughout eternity.”</p>

<p><em>God’s will be done, not man’s; God’s pattern,
not man’s</em> pattern, is the command we find running
through all the scriptures, and the Bible is a
book dealing with the science of the mind. It is a
book telling man how to release his soul (or subconscious
mind) from bondage.</p>

<p>The battles described are pictures of man waging
war against mortal thoughts. “A man’s foes
shall be they of his own household.” Every man is
Jehoshaphat, and every man is David, who slays
Goliath (mortal thinking) with the little white
stone (faith).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>So man must be careful that he is not the
“wicked and slothful servant” who buried his
talent. There is a terrible penalty to be paid for
not using one’s ability.</p>

<p>Often fear stands between man and his perfect
self-expression. Stage-fright has hampered many a
genius. This may be overcome by the spoken
word, or treatment. The individual then loses all
self-consciousness, and feels simply that he is a
channel for Infinite Intelligence to express Itself
through.</p>

<p>He is under direct inspiration, fearless, and
confident; for he feels that it is the “Father within”
him who does the work.</p>

<p>A young boy came often to my class with his
mother. He asked me to “speak the word” for his
coming examinations at school.</p>

<p>I told him to make the statement: “I am one
with Infinite Intelligence. I know everything I
should know on this subject.” He had an excellent
knowledge of history, but was not sure of his arithmetic.
I saw him afterwards, and he said: “I spoke
the word for my arithmetic, and passed with the
highest honors; but thought I could depend on
myself for history, and got a very poor mark.”
Man often receives a set-back when he is “too sure
of himself,” which means he is trusting to his
personality and not the “Father within.”</p>

<p>Another one of my students gave me an example
of this. She took an extended trip abroad one
summer, visiting many countries, where she was
ignorant of the languages. She was calling for
guidance and protection every minute, and her
affairs went smoothly and miraculously. Her luggage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
was never delayed nor lost! Accommodations
were always ready for her at the best hotels; and
she had perfect service wherever she went. She returned
to New York. Knowing the language, she
felt God was no longer necessary, so looked after
her affairs in an ordinary manner.</p>

<p><em>Everything went wrong</em>, her trunks delayed,
amid inharmony and confusion. The student must
form the habit of “practicing the Presence of God”
every minute. “<em>In all thy ways acknowledge him</em>;”
nothing is too small or too great.</p>

<p>Sometimes an insignificant incident may be the
turning point in a man’s life.</p>

<p>Robert Fulton, watching some boiling water,
simmering in a tea kettle, saw a steamboat!</p>

<p>I have seen a student, often, keep back his
demonstration, through resistance, or pointing
the way.</p>

<p>He pins his faith to one channel only, and dictates
just the way he desires the manifestation to
come, which brings things to a standstill.</p>

<p>“<em>My way, not your way!</em>” is the command of
Infinite Intelligence. Like all Power, be it steam
or electricity, it must have a nonresistant engine or
instrument to work through, and man is that engine
or instrument.</p>

<p>Over and over again, man is told to “stand still”.
“Oh Judah, fear not; but tomorrow go out against
them, for the Lord will be with you. You shall not
need to fight this battle; set yourselves, stand ye
still, and see the salvation of the Lord with you.”</p>

<p>We see this in the incidents of the two thousand
dollars coming to the woman through the landlord
when she became <em>nonresistant</em> and <em>undisturbed</em>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
and the woman who won the man’s love “after all
suffering had ceased.”</p>

<p>The student’s goal is <em>Poise!</em> <em>Poise</em> is <em>Power</em>, for it
gives God-Power a chance to rush through man,
to “will and to do Its good pleasure.”</p>

<p>Poised, he thinks clearly, and makes “right decisions
quickly.” “He never misses a trick.”</p>

<p>Anger blurs the visions, poisons the blood, is the
root of many diseases, and causes wrong decision
leading to failure.</p>

<p>It has been named one of the worst “sins,” as its
reaction is so harmful. The student learns that in
metaphysics sin has a much broader meaning than
in the old teaching. “Whatsoever is not of faith is
sin.”</p>

<p>He finds that fear and worry are deadly sins.
They are inverted faith, and through distorted
mental pictures, bring to pass the thing he fears.
His work is to drive out these enemies (from the
subconscious mind). “When Man is <em>fearless he is
finished</em>!” Maeterlinck says, that “Man is God
afraid.”</p>

<p>So, as we read in the previous chapters: Man
can only vanquish fear by walking up to the thing
he is afraid of. When Jehoshaphat and his army
prepared to meet the enemy, singing “Praise the
Lord, for his mercy endureth forever,” they found
their enemies had destroyed each other, and there
was nothing to fight.</p>

<p>For example: A woman asked a friend to deliver
a message to another friend. The woman feared to
give the message, as the reasoning mind said,
“Don’t get mixed-up in this affair, don’t give that
message.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>She was troubled in spirit, for she had given her
promise. At last, she determined to “walk up to
the lion,” and call on the law of divine protection.
She met the friend to whom she was to deliver the
message. She opened her mouth to speak it, when
her friend said, “So-and-So has left town.” This
made it unnecessary to give the message, as the
situation depended upon the person being in
town. As she was willing to do it, she was not
obliged to; as she did not fear, the situation vanished.</p>

<p>The student often delays his demonstration
through a belief in incompletion. He should make
this statement:</p>

<p>“In Divine Mind there is only completion, therefore,
my demonstration is completed. My perfect
work, my perfect home, my perfect health.”
Whatever he demands are perfect ideas registered
in Divine Mind, and must manifest, “under grace
in a perfect way.” He gives thanks he has already
received on the invisible, and makes active preparation
for receiving on the visible.</p>

<p>One of my students was in need of a financial
demonstration. She came to me and asked why it
was not completed.</p>

<p>I replied: “Perhaps, you are in the habit of
leaving things unfinished, and the subconscious
has gotten into the habit of not completing (as the
without, so the within).”</p>

<p>She said, “You are right. I often <em>begin things</em>
and never finish them.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go home and finish something I commenced
weeks ago, and I know it will be symbolic
of my demonstration.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>So she sewed assiduously, and the article was
soon completed. Shortly after, the money came in
a most curious manner.</p>

<p>Her husband was paid his salary twice that
month. He told the people of their mistake, and
they sent word to keep it.</p>

<p>When man asks, <em>believing, he must receive, for
God creates His own channels</em>!</p>

<p>I have been sometimes asked, “Suppose one has
several talents, how is he to know which one to
choose?” Demand to be shown definitely. Say: “Infinite
Spirit, give me a definite lead, reveal to me
my perfect self-expression, show me which talent I
am to make use of now.”</p>

<p>I have known people to suddenly enter a new
line of work, and be fully equipped, with little or
no training. So make the statement: “<em>I am fully
equipped for the Divine Plan of my life</em>,” and be
fearless in grasping opportunities.</p>

<p>Some people are cheerful givers, but bad receivers.
They refuse gifts through pride, or some
negative reason, thereby blocking their channels,
and invariably find themselves eventually with little
or nothing. For example: A woman who had
given away a great deal of money, had a gift
offered her of several thousand dollars. She refused
to take it, saying she did not need it. Shortly
after that, her finances were “tied up,” and she
found herself in debt for that amount. Man should
receive gracefully the bread returning to him upon
the water—freely ye have given, freely ye shall
receive.</p>

<p>There is always the perfect balance of giving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
and receiving, and though man should give without
thinking of returns, he violates law if he does
not accept the returns which come to him; for all
gifts are from God, man being merely the channel.</p>

<p>A thought of lack should never be held over the
giver.</p>

<p>For example: When the man gave me the one
cent, I did not say: “Poor man, he cannot afford
to give me that.” I saw him rich and prosperous,
with his supply pouring in. It was this thought
which brought it. If one has been a bad receiver,
he must become a good one, and take even a
postage stamp if it is given him, and open up his
channels for receiving.</p>

<p>The Lord loveth a cheerful receiver, as well as a
cheerful giver.</p>

<p>I have often been asked why one man is born
rich and healthy, and another poor and sick.</p>

<p>Where there is an effect there is always a cause;
there is no such thing as chance.</p>

<p>This question is answered through the law of
reincarnation. Man goes through many births and
deaths, until he knows the truth which sets him
free.</p>

<p>He is drawn back to the earth plane through
unsatisfied desire, to pay his Karmic debts, or to
“fulfill his destiny.”</p>

<p>The man born rich and healthy has had pictures
in his subconscious mind, in his past life, of
health and riches; and the poor and sick man, of
disease and poverty. Man manifests, on any plane,
the sum total of his subconscious beliefs.</p>

<p>However, birth and death are man-made laws,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
for the “wages of sin is death”; the Adamic fall in
consciousness through the belief in <em>two powers</em>.
The real man, spiritual man, is birthless and
deathless! He never was born and has never died—“As
he was in the beginning, he is now, and ever
shall be!”</p>

<p>So through the truth, man is set free from the
law of Karma, sin and death, and manifests the
man made in “His image and likeness.” Man’s
freedom comes through fulfilling his destiny,
bringing into manifestation the Divine Design of
his life.</p>

<p>His lord will say unto him: “Well done thou
good and faithful servant, thou hast been faithful
over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many
things (death itself); enter thou into the joy of thy
Lord (eternal life).”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="DENIALS_AND_AFFIRMATIONS">DENIALS AND AFFIRMATIONS</h2>
</div>


<p>“Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be
established unto thee.”</p>

<p>All the good that is to be made manifest in
man’s life is already an accomplished fact in divine
mind, and is released through man’s recognition,
or spoken word, so he must be careful to decree
that only the Divine Idea be made manifest, for
often, he decrees, through his “idle words,” failure
or misfortune.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, of the utmost importance, to
word one’s demands correctly, as stated in a previous
chapter.</p>

<p>If one desires a home, friend, position or any
other good thing, make the demand for the “divine
selection.”</p>

<p>For example: “Infinite Spirit, open the way for
my right home, my right friend, my right position.
I give thanks <em>it now manifests under grace in a
perfect way</em>.”</p>

<p>The latter part of the statement is most important.
For example: I knew a woman who demanded
a thousand dollars. Her daughter was
injured and they received a thousand dollars indemnity,
so it did not come in a “perfect way.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
The demand should have been worded in this
way: “Infinite Spirit, I give thanks that the one
thousand dollars, which is mine by divine right, is
now released, and reaches me under grace, in a
perfect way.”</p>

<p>As one grows in a financial consciousness, he
should demand that the enormous sums of money,
which are his by divine right, reach him under
grace, in perfect ways.</p>

<p>It is impossible for man to release more than he
thinks is possible, for one is bound by the limited
expectancies of the subconscious. He must enlarge
his expectancies in order to receive in a larger
way.</p>

<p>Man so often limits himself in his demands. For
example: A student made the demand for six
hundred dollars, by a certain date. He did receive
it, but heard afterwards, that he came very near
receiving a thousand dollars, but he was given just
six hundred, as the result of his spoken word.</p>

<p>“They limited the Holy One of Israel.” Wealth
is a matter of consciousness. The French have a
legend giving an example of this. A poor man was
walking along a road when he met a traveler, who
stopped him and said: “My good friend, I see you
are poor. Take this gold nugget, sell it, and you
will be rich all your days.”</p>

<p>The man was overjoyed at his good fortune, and
took the nugget home. He immediately found
work and became so prosperous that he did not
sell the nugget. Years passed, and he became a
very rich man. One day he met a poor man on the
road. He stopped him and said: “My good friend,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
I will give you this gold nugget, which, if you sell,
will make you rich for life.” The mendicant took
the nugget, had it valued, and found it was only
brass. So we see, the first man became rich
through feeling rich, thinking the nugget was
gold.</p>

<p>Every man has within himself a gold nugget; <em>it
is his consciousness of gold, of opulence, which
brings riches into his life</em>. In making his demands,
man begins at his <em>journey’s end</em>, that is, he declares
<em>he has already received</em>. “<em>Before</em> ye call I
shall answer.”</p>

<p>Continually affirming establishes the belief in
the subconscious.</p>

<p>It would not be necessary to make an affirmation
more than once if one had perfect faith! One
should not plead or supplicate, but give thanks
repeatedly, that he has received.</p>

<p>“The desert shall <em>rejoice</em> and blossom as the
rose.” This rejoicing which is yet in the desert
(state of consciousness) opens the way for release.
The Lord’s Prayer is in the form of command and
demand, “Give us this day our daily bread, and
forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors,”
and ends in praise, “For thine is the Kingdom and
the Power and the Glory, forever. Amen.” “Concerning
the works of my hands, command ye me.”
So prayer is command and demand, praise and
thanksgiving. The student’s work is in making
himself believe that “with God all things are possible.”</p>

<p>This is easy enough to state in the abstract, but
a little more difficult when confronted with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
problem. For example: It was necessary for a
woman to demonstrate a large sum of money within
a stated time. She knew she must <em>do something</em>
to get a realization (for realization is manifestation),
and she demanded a “lead.”</p>

<p>She was walking through a department store,
when she saw a very beautiful pink enamel papercutter.
She felt the “pull” towards it. The thought
came. “I haven’t a paper cutter good enough to
open letters containing large cheques.”</p>

<p>So she bought the papercutter, which the reasoning
mind would have called an extravagance.
When she held it in her hand, she had a flash of a
picture of herself opening an envelope containing
a large cheque, and in a few weeks, she received
the money. The pink papercutter was her bridge
of active faith.</p>

<p>Many stories are told of the power of the subconscious
when directed in faith.</p>

<p>For example: A man was spending the night in
a farmhouse. The windows of the room had been
nailed down, and in the middle of the night he felt
suffocated and made his way in the dark to the
window. He could not open it, so he smashed the
pane with his fist, drew in draughts of fine fresh
air, and had a wonderful night’s sleep.</p>

<p>The next morning, he found he had smashed
the glass of a bookcase and the window had remained
closed during the whole night. He had
<em>supplied himself with oxygen, simply by his
thought of oxygen</em>.</p>

<p>When a student starts out to demonstrate, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
should never turn back. “Let not that man who
wavers think that he shall receive anything of the
Lord.”</p>

<p>A colored student once made this wonderful
statement, “When I asks the Father for anything,
I puts my foot down, and I says: Father, I’ll take
nothing less than I’ve asked for, but more!” So
man should never compromise: “Having done all—Stand.”
This is sometimes the most difficult
time of demonstrating. The temptation comes to
give up, to turn back, to compromise.</p>

<p>“He also serves who only stands and waits.”</p>

<p>Demonstrations often come at the eleventh hour
because man then lets go, that is, stops reasoning,
and Infinite Intelligence has a chance to work.</p>

<p>“Man’s dreary desires are answered drearily,
and his impatient desires, long delayed or violently
fulfilled.”</p>

<p>For example: A woman asked me why it was she
was constantly losing or breaking her glasses.</p>

<p>We found she often said to herself and others
with vexation, “I wish I could get rid of my
glasses.” So her impatient desire was violently fulfilled.
What she should have demanded was perfect
eye-sight, but what she registered in the subconscious
was simply the impatient desire to be rid
of her glasses; so they were continually being
broken or lost.</p>

<p>Two attitudes of mind cause loss: depreciation,
as in the case of the woman who did not appreciate
her husband, <em>or fear of loss</em>, which makes a
picture of loss in the subconscious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<p>When a student is able to let go of his problem
(cast his burden) he will have instantaneous manifestation.</p>

<p>For example: A woman was out during a very
stormy day and her umbrella was blown inside-out.
She was about to make a call on some people
whom she had never met and she did not wish to
make her first appearance with a dilapidated umbrella.
She could not throw it away, as it did not
belong to her. So in desperation, she exclaimed:
“Oh, God, you take charge of this umbrella, I
don’t know what to do.”</p>

<p>A moment later, a voice behind her said:
“Lady, do you want your umbrella mended?”
There stood an umbrella mender.</p>

<p>She replied, “Indeed, I do.”</p>

<p>The man mended the umbrella, while she went
into the house to pay her call, and when she
returned, she had a good umbrella. So there is
always an umbrella mender at hand, on man’s
pathway, when one puts the umbrella (or situation)
in God’s Hands.</p>

<p>One should always follow a denial with an affirmation.</p>

<p>For example: I was called on the ’phone late one
night to treat a man whom I had never seen. He
was apparently very ill. I made the statement: “I
deny this appearance of disease. It is unreal,
therefore cannot register in his consciousness; this
man is a perfect idea in Divine Mind, pure substance
expressing perfection.”</p>

<p>There is no time or space, in Divine Mind,
therefore the word reaches instantly its destination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
and does not “return void.” I have treated patients
in Europe and have found that the result
was instantaneous.</p>

<p>I am asked so often the difference between
visualizing and visioning. Visualizing is a mental
process governed by the reasoning or conscious
mind; visioning is a spiritual process, governed by
intuition, or the superconscious mind. The student
should train his mind to receive these flashes
of inspiration, and work out the “divine pictures,”
through definite leads. When a man can say, “I
desire only that which God desires for me,” his
false desires fade from the consciousness, and a
new set of blueprints is given him by the Master
Architect, the God within. God’s plan for each
man transcends the limitation of the reasoning
mind, and is always the square of life, containing
health, wealth, love and perfect self-expression.
Many a man is building for himself in imagination
a bungalow when he should be building a palace.</p>

<p>If a student tries to force a demonstration
(through the reasoning mind) he brings it to a
standstill. “I will hasten it,” saith the Lord. He
should act only through intuition, or definite
leads. “Rest in the Lord and wait patiently. Trust
also in him, and he will bring it to pass.”</p>

<p>I have seen the law work in the most astonishing
manner. For example: A student stated that it
was necessary for her to have a hundred dollars by
the following day. It was a debt of vital importance
which had to be met. I “spoke the word,”
declaring Spirit was “never too late” and that the
supply was at hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>That evening she phoned me of the miracle.
She said that the thought came to her to go to her
safe-deposit box at the bank to examine some
papers. She looked over the papers, and at the
bottom of the box, was a new one hundred dollar-bill.
She was astounded, and said she knew she
had never put it there, for she had gone through
the papers many times. It may have been a materialization,
as Jesus Christ materialized the
loaves and fishes. Man will reach the stage where
his “word is made flesh,” or materialized, instantly.
“The fields, ripe with the harvest,” will manifest
immediately, as in all of the miracles of Jesus
Christ.</p>

<p>There is a tremendous power alone in the name
Jesus Christ. It stands for <em>Truth Made Manifest</em>.
He said, “Whatsoever ye ask the Father, in my
name, he will give it to you.”</p>

<p>The power of this name raises the student into
the fourth dimension, where he is freed from all
astral and psychic influences, and he becomes
“unconditioned and absolute, as God Himself is
unconditioned and absolute.”</p>

<p>I have seen many healings accomplished by
using the words, “In the name of Jesus Christ.”</p>

<p>Christ was both person and principle; and the
Christ within each man is his Redeemer and Salvation.</p>

<p>The Christ within, is his own fourth dimensional
self, the man made in God’s image and likeness.
This is the self which has never failed, never
known sickness or sorrow, was never born and has
never died. It is the “resurrection and the life” of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
each man! “No man cometh to the Father save by
the Son,” means, that God, the Universal, working
on the place of the particular, becomes the Christ
in man; and the Holy Ghost, means God-in-action.
So daily, man is manifesting the Trinity of
Father, Son and Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>Man should make an art of thinking. The Master
Thinker is an artist and is careful to paint only
the divine designs upon the canvas of his mind;
and he paints these pictures with masterly strokes
of power and decision, having perfect faith that
there is no power to mar their perfection and that
they shall manifest in his life the ideal made real.</p>

<p>All power is given man (through right thinking)
to bring <em>his heaven</em> upon <em>his earth</em>, and this is the
<em>goal of the</em> “<em>Game of Life</em>.”</p>

<p>The simple rules are fearless faith, nonresistance
and love!</p>

<p>May each reader be now freed from that thing
which has held him in bondage through the ages,
standing between him and his own, and “know the
Truth which makes him free”—free to fulfill his
destiny, to bring into manifestation the “<em>Divine
Design of his life</em>, Health, Wealth, Love and Perfect
Self-Expression.” “Be ye transformed by the
renewing of your mind.”</p>
